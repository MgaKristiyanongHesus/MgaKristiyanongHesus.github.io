      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of us squeeze toothpaste from the middle, and some squeeze it from the bottom. Bottom squeezers would like the world to follow their example; but middle squeezers argue that such obsession with order infringes on their spontaneous individuality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We do not have to be perfect to be accepted by God. But we do need to be original.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Love For Leftovers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have often heard people complaining about having to eat &amp;ldquo;leftovers&amp;rdquo;. It baffles me, because it is said as though there is something inferior about leftovers. Food that was absolutely delicious the night before suddenly gets this terrible reputation the next day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Utopia is an ideal world that does not exist. People searching for such a place often abandon ideals altogether when they fail to find it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The secular media has been around for a long time. Before newspapers and television it was the far less reliable word-of-mouth. It was this secular medium that crucified Jesus. The same crowd that shouted &amp;ldquo;Hosanna!&amp;rdquo; one week was shouting &amp;ldquo;Crucify him!&amp;rdquo; the next.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On our flight back to Sydney from Kenya on the weekend, Cherry and I watched a movie called &amp;ldquo;The Day the Earth Stood Still&amp;rdquo; (a remake of a film that first came out decades ago). I was deeply impressed with it in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
