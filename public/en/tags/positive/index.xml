      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to a church meeting yesterday, and the Bible reading was the Old Testament promise that God would not allow one of his righteous servants so much as to stub his toe against a stone. If he fell, the passage promised that God would send an angel to catch him. The congregation did not appear to see any contradiction (or even a connection) in the fact that the reading was preceded by an announcement that the pastor was not there because he had fallen off the back of his ute, and broken his wrist pretty badly. Apart from the obvious humour of that situation, there was the oft ignored contradiction that some of the things we read in the Bible do not seem to measure up to our everyday experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the early years of our community, we all actively participated in fun runs. The more serious runners would often say, &amp;ldquo;No pain, no gain.&amp;rdquo; I was sometimes amazed at the amount of discipline some athletes exercised in order to excel in their sport. Hours of every day would be taken up with developing physical fitness, speed, and endurance. To excel, they had to learn to push through what was called &amp;ldquo;the pain barrier&amp;rdquo;. But when they succeeded, they would come out on the other side as winners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a greater sin than not obeying Jesus; it is the sin of not believing that he loves you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a vision that was very strong and that seemed significant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
