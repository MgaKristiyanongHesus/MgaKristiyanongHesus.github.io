      <title>Living In Community</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have always believed that living in community (as we do, and as the early Christians did) is somewhat optional. It is not commanded (in so many words) in what Jesus taught, although he and his disciples obviously lived together, travelled together, and had a common purse. I have felt strongly about the spiritual benefits of such a lifestyle; but I just didn&amp;rsquo;t think there was a case for making it absolutely essential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Utopia is an ideal world that does not exist. People searching for such a place often abandon ideals altogether when they fail to find it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
