      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is nothing particularly &amp;lsquo;Quakerish&amp;rsquo; about this article, except as it could relate to the concept of silent worship, where Friends believe that God can speak to people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Freedom, Prayer, and Besetting Sins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a few different thoughts I would like to share with people, each one probably worthy of a short article on its own. However, until or unless I get some spare time to do them as separate articles, I will just kind of mix them all in together in this letter, since there is a common theme between them. The theme is just an expression of concern about where people are heading spiritually, particularly in light of individual bases now being autonomous to one another.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Job List, Budgets, and Schedules</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best inventions in history must be that of daily schedules. Wristwatches (especially, cheap wristwatches) must be the next best invention. They made it possible for virtually everyone to co-ordinate their various schedules, so that people could arrange to be in the same place at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Love For Leftovers</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/en/blog/my-love-for-leftovers/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have often heard people complaining about having to eat &amp;ldquo;leftovers&amp;rdquo;. It baffles me, because it is said as though there is something inferior about leftovers. Food that was absolutely delicious the night before suddenly gets this terrible reputation the next day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reality in Utopia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Utopia is an ideal world that does not exist. People searching for such a place often abandon ideals altogether when they fail to find it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People often write to us who are not satisfied with what they see in the churches today, and so they want to start their own ministry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Space Without Spice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is a continuation of a topic which has been coming up a lot in the past couple of years. It deals with the dilemma that exists when a leader (or the community as a whole) encounters someone who shows some good spiritual signs, but who also shows an unwillingness to deal with some particular weakness or fault. Our traditional approach has been to take a grievance with the offender, and to advance the grievance from first stage to second, to third, and finally to kick them out of the community if they continue their refusal to deal with the offence. The process is scriptural and beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The secular media has been around for a long time. Before newspapers and television it was the far less reliable word-of-mouth. It was this secular medium that crucified Jesus. The same crowd that shouted &amp;ldquo;Hosanna!&amp;rdquo; one week was shouting &amp;ldquo;Crucify him!&amp;rdquo; the next.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Forsake All Principle</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/en/blog/the-forsake-all-principle/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/en/blog/the-forsake-all-principle/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a principle in spiritual matters that people from many faiths have discovered. We call it the &amp;ldquo;forsake all&amp;rdquo; principle. But it could be described in many other ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
