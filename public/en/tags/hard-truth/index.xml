&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why we do not teach much about forsaking parents is because it is something that we just do in practical terms, more than we actually teach it in theoretical terms. We forsake our parents merely by living together communally, seven days a week. Young people who suddenly decide to join a community like our own (after having lived with their parents) &amp;ldquo;forsake&amp;rdquo; the relationship that they had at home as a natural consequence of choosing to move in with us. This is not terribly different from what happens when a young person leaves home to get married, move into a flat on their own, move into student accommodation at a university, or travel or work abroad.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hearing What We Don't Want to Hear</title><link>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/hearing-what-we-dont-want-to-hear/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/hearing-what-we-dont-want-to-hear/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;What I want to say here is so basic that it&amp;rsquo;s almost a first requirement for faith. And yet it seems to be so rare (and so hard to communicate) that it hardly exists in the world today.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Prevericating</title><link>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/prevericating/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/prevericating/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Prevaricating is defined as: &amp;ldquo;speaking evasively; equivocating&amp;rdquo;. And equivocating is defined as: &amp;ldquo;using vague or intentionally evasive language&amp;rdquo;. Whichever term you choose to use for it, there is a lot of this that goes on in the world today, and it happens far too often in our community as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Good Hindu</title><link>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/the-good-hindu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/the-good-hindu/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A religious man asked Jesus, &amp;ldquo;What can I do to have eternal life?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Reason</title><link>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/the-reason/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/the-reason/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;_It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household? &lt;a href="http://jesuschristians.com/bible/B40C010.htm#V25"

It is becoming harder and harder for us to convince people that we are just another (safe) religious group.  Sooner or later they hear that there is a lot of nasty stuff being said about us, and with google being so handy these days, the question comes sooner rather than later: i.e. &amp;ldquo;Why is everyone saying such nasty stuff about you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
