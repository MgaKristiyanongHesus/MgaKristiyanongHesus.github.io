      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a term that I have heard for many years and just kind of assumed I was missing something when I heard it. The word is intuition. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how it has been used in the past, but I know that I mostly hear it used when comparing males and females. Females are told that they have intuitive skills, or that they think intuitively, whereas men think in some other way, e.g. rationally. Unless I&amp;rsquo;ve missed something, it always seemed to imply two things, both of which I would like to challenge in this article: (1) that intuition is some kind of a skill; and (2) that women have some kind of a special claim on this skill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
