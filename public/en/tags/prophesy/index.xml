The Revelation is an integral part of the whole message of God in the Bible, and the key to understanding the book of Revelation is the teachings of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>May Your Kingdom Come</title><link>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/may-your-kingdom-come/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/may-your-kingdom-come/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As people with a serious concern for the welfare of this planet, the return of Christ offers us hope.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Servants of The Antichrist</title><link>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/slaves-of-the-antichrist/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/slaves-of-the-antichrist/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Left Behind&lt;/em&gt; series is inspiring, in that it makes people think about serious, life-and-death situations. Yet it tends to assume that, even in the face of disaster, life for fundamentalist American Christians will center around the same values and goals that have dominated their lives up until now. In other words, people will still go to church on Sundays and work in system jobs the rest of the week, right through the Tribulation and all that comes with it. They will still be loaded with money, and they will still jet around the world at will. There is nothing in the book that speaks to the condition of poor Christians. This materialistic philosophy is practised at a time (in the story) when people should be seriously considering whether the values they lived by before the trouble began were really the right ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Signs of The Times</title><link>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/signs-of-the-times/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/signs-of-the-times/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;War and Peace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wars are the most common proof given that the end of the world is near. Yet they are mentioned specifically by Christ as proof that the end has not come: &amp;ldquo;You will hear of wars and rumours of wars. Do not let this trouble you, for all these things must happen, but the end is not yet.&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=Matthew&amp;#43;24%3A6;&amp;amp;version=50;&amp;amp;interface=print"

How silly!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
