But on closer inspection, it appears that the churches themselves do not believe the gospel they preach.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Convenient Doctrines</title><link>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/convenient-doctrines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/convenient-doctrines/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Most people have wondered at times at the number of strange and contradictory doctrines that circle the globe in the name of God. Religion is a mass of conflicting statements, a jungle too dense for most educated people these days to even consider seeking refuge in it. As soon as we become smart enough to examine even two churches or religions side by side, we see enough contradictions to know that they cannot both be right. And by the time that we have been through three or four, a doubt begins to grow that any of them could be right.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Living By Faith</title><link>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/live-by-faith/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/live-by-faith/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is the third in a series of articles on doctrinal differences between ourselves and The Family. The first two articles were &amp;ldquo;Simple Salvation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Eternal Salvation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Miracles</title><link>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/miracles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/miracles/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you understand how a miracle works, is it still a miracle? If I can do something you have no explanation for, does that make me spiritually superior to you? What is a miracle anyway? These are just a few of the questions which have perplexed me as I have tried to understand what my position should be with regard to the supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Simple Salvation</title><link>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/simple-salvation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/simple-salvation/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A member of The Family (formerly the Children of God) commented that he found it difficult to understand how we could consider them heretics and our best friends at the same time. Heretic is not a word that we would choose, because it has so much emotional judgment attached to it. But it is true that we have differences, at the same time that we have much in common; and we too have laboured to understand this paradox. The next five articles compare our similarities and difference on a number of teachings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Fear of the Devil</title><link>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/the-fear-of-the-devil/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/the-fear-of-the-devil/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Most religions promote fear of the devil. But what you fear is what you worship. If you are afraid of the devil, he need only say, &amp;ldquo;X is evil!&amp;rdquo; and you will run from X. Obviously, he is going to make sure that what you run away from is exactly what you need to face.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Golden Thread</title><link>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/the-golden-thread/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/the-golden-thread/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I had a vision that was very strong and that seemed significant.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Spirit of Christ</title><link>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/the-spirit-of-christ/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/the-spirit-of-christ/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Christian tradition has tended to exaggerate the distinction between the Son of God and God&amp;rsquo;s Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Tentmaking Myth</title><link>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/the-tent-making-myth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mgakristiyanonghesus.github.io/en/blog/the-tent-making-myth/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Catholics, Evangelicals, Pentecostals, High and Low Church Anglicans, Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witnesses, the Children of God, Mormons - in fact, every denomination and sect we know of - has one belief in common: they all support the tentmaking myth.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
