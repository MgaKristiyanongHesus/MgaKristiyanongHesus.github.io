      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: The term &amp;ldquo;social conscience&amp;rdquo; as used in this article has a different meaning (within the Jesus Christian community) to that which it normally has in society. We are talking about giving in to pressure from society to behave in certain ways which may actually be contrary to what a genuine conscience might teach us. An example of this would be social pressure to participate in war, which can make a sincere conscientious objector feel &amp;ldquo;guilty&amp;rdquo; for not conforming. We are NOT referring to &amp;ldquo;social conscience&amp;rdquo; in the way it is normally used (i.e. to feel a need to help others who are in need). That kind of social conscience is something with which we would agree.It has struck me that I must have failed somewhere in my attempts to teach people to recognise and follow what we call our conscience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
