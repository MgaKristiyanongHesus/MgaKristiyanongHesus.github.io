I will attempt to explain that in this article.\nThe two words that seem to jump out at us in the passage above are \u0026ldquo;study\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;word\u0026rdquo;. Because of these two words, it seems quite reasonable to think that the passage is talking about studying a book of some sort. But when the Apostle Paul was writing that in a letter to young Timothy, the New Testament had not even been fully written, and even the Old Testament was not available to the average believer. Books as such rarely existed in the average home. So what could he have been talking about?\nBecause the passage talks about us needing to be \u0026ldquo;approved unto God\u0026rdquo;, we get the idea that he was talking about something important. Tradition has said that studying the Bible is important, to the point where the Bible almost BECOMES God. But if it\u0026rsquo;s not specifically the Bible that Paul was encouraging Timothy to study, then what was it? If we really want to please God, the answer to this question should be worth searching for.\nAnother phrase suggests that it may have something to do with some kind of practical skills. Paul talks about a \u0026ldquo;workman who needeth not to be ashamed\u0026rdquo;. Certainly in any type of work, whether painting a car, planting onions, filling in tax forms, or preaching a sermon, it is important for \u0026ldquo;workmen\u0026rdquo; to be able to do jobs for which they need not be ashamed. So it is possible that the \u0026ldquo;study\u0026rdquo; we are talking about here is as simple as doing a good job at school, in an apprenticeship, or when working for an employer\u0026hellip; so that you become a \u0026ldquo;workman/workwoman who does not need to be ashamed\u0026rdquo; of the work you are doing.\nBut then there is the final phrase: \u0026ldquo;rightly dividing the word of truth\u0026rdquo;. This suggests something more than a well designed cabinet or a well executed jump shot in basketball. There is something about the kind of studying that Paul is encouraging that will help someone to find truth, and more than that, to be able to divide or discern the truth from what is untruth. This phrase in itself should have told us years ago that the verse is probably not talking about the Bible OR about getting ahead in our jobs.\nMy own feeling (now) is that this is talking about discernment, about wisdom, about counsel, about thinking. God wants us to think\u0026hellip; to use our minds\u0026hellip; to consider the issues that are put before us daily and try to discern the best way to apply them in our lives.\nLately I have been thinking a lot about \u0026ldquo;counselling\u0026rdquo; and the need for all members of any organisation or community to take an active part in decision-making. It means being able to debate the issues in our minds, to consider the pros and cons, to \u0026ldquo;trouble-shoot\u0026rdquo;. Yet these seem to be some of the rarest traits in the world today. Everywhere you look there are people who are prepared to become puppets for the nearest puppet-master. They don\u0026rsquo;t want to think; they just want someone else to make the decisions for them, so that they can take comfort in the fact that they are in safe hands.\nThis picture of mindless zombies is often presented with regard to new religious movements, and yet it is, in my opinion, far more prevalent in the workaday world. There are people who reach retirement and just can\u0026rsquo;t handle the responsibility of having to decide for themselves when to get up in the morning, what to do throughout the day, and when to change from one thing to another. It all reflects the way they have lived their lives, never questioning, and rarely taking initiative. Sadly, the world is full of people who are only too ready to enlist as pawns for the nearest power-broker.\nFor almost 30 years my oldest son lived with me and worked with me in the Christian community that my wife and I set up. He was one of the most helpful members of that community, and all because of his ability to question things, and to argue his case well. True, his disagreements used to drive me up the wall at times, but even when he seemed to be arguing just for the sake of arguing, it required him to think. As a result, I knew that if he was left in charge of any situation, he would be pretty much able to handle it. And all because he had learned to think.\nI never took debating in school, but it sounds like one of the best subjects one can take. Most people think, \u0026ldquo;Ugh! Arguments! I hate them. How depressing! How negative!\u0026rdquo; But, of course, what happens on a debating team is that they teach you to argue whichever side you are instructed to argue, and not just the one that you would prefer. In other words, overall, you are forced to consider both sides, all of the pros and cons. In short, you learn to think.\nI wish that more Christian believers would actually learn to question their faith at times, just so that they can think through the issues and come out more convincing and more convinced in what it is that they do believe. Thinking outside the box will invariably generate controversy, but all of that will better equip you for whatever it is that you ultimately decide to do with your life. Whatever it is that we believe or do right now will eventually become dead traditions if we don\u0026rsquo;t know why we chose them, and if we are not continuing to keep the issues clear in our own minds and in the minds of others.\nI was thinking about the word \u0026ldquo;rational\u0026rdquo; the other day. It comes from the same root word as \u0026ldquo;reason\u0026rdquo; and we often talk about \u0026ldquo;reasoning\u0026rdquo; as a form of arguing. But more than that, the word \u0026ldquo;reason\u0026rdquo; on its own is linked with the word \u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; And that\u0026rsquo;s the word we need to be asking ourselves constantly if we want to keep from losing our way. Why are we doing this? Why do we think it is important? Why does someone else oppose it? Why were we put here on this planet? If we are not questioning our motives and the motives of those around us, we are sooner or later going to start sounding pretty irrational (i.e. \u0026ldquo;without reason\u0026rdquo;).\nSome people go quiet in a discussin because they say that they are not good at arguing their position. But you don\u0026rsquo;t become a good basketball player by only playing chess. It\u0026rsquo;s practice that makes perfect, and if you know that you are inexperienced in arguing your point, then even that little piece of truth should help you to be more tentative and humble in the points you try to make.\nSuccessfully arguing a point is not just a matter of being able to rant and rave. It comes from thinking seriously about what you believe and from being able to honestly examine the weaknesses as well as the strong points. With practice, you will gain more confidence, and you will be prepared for the counter-arguments that your own statements are going to elicit, so that you don\u0026rsquo;t put your foot in your mouth (or at least not so often)!\nIn closing, let me encourage everyone to take practical steps toward kicking their brains into gear on any of the hundreds of issues that surround you every day. Think about what could go wrong. Think about what could work. Listen to what others are saying. Then move forward with confidence as well as humility, knowing that you are actively seeking to be \u0026ldquo;a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth\u0026rdquo; in all that you do.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/a-letter-to-a-friend/","title":"A Letter to a Friend","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/quak/Letter_hu_111668fe2b1a8e13.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/quak\\/Letter_hu_b39b75c11d8ab4ee.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/quak/Letter_hu_f236424450bd3aa9.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/quak\\/Letter_hu_75498157f8b7af98.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Quaker Similarities","tags":"Random","content":"The Jesus Christian approach to universalism (which is not the approach of any Australian Quakers that we know of apart from ourselves) is that Jesus somehow enabled God to provide universal salvation. Below is a letter we wrote to a conservative believer who challenged our claim that non-Christians may actually be saved through the blood of Christ (and the grace of God) as long as they are walking in all the light that they have.\nDear Friend,\nThanks for taking the time to comment on our article Universalism, Pros and Cons. It would probably help in our communication if we could remember that neither of us has perfect understanding of all things. Truth is truth and God is God regardless of our various teachings (whether they be heresies or otherwise). In other words, truth is not an argument.\nIf, for example, my understanding about the grace of God is wrong, then no amount of arguing on my part is going to make it right. Nor am I going to be able to \u0026ldquo;save\u0026rdquo; anyone just by getting them to accept what I teach. But remember that the same is true for everyone, including yourself. We must each be careful that we do not defend our doctrines in preference to finding God\u0026rsquo;s Truth.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s work on the assumption that you are right. Certainly you have produced some interesting verses in support of your argument. I think the best one is the statement by Jesus that you and I are not Christians if we are not obeying his teachings. (e.g. Luke 14:33, John 8:31, and John 15:10-12) You say that these heathen people could not be obeying Jesus if they have not even heard what he taught. (See Another Cornerstone.) But let me ask you: How strongly do you believe that obedience to the teachings of Jesus is the mark of a true Christian? How obedient have you yourself been to the teachings of Jesus?\nI ask this, because although you made reference to Jesus saying that we must obey him, the overall gist of your letter seems to be pointing toward something other than obedience to Jesus as the key to salvation. In particular, you referred to a lot of verses that mentioned our need to \u0026ldquo;preach the gospel\u0026rdquo; to the heathen. You seem to be saying that these people cannot be \u0026ldquo;saved\u0026rdquo; until they hear something from us (the \u0026ldquo;gospel\u0026rdquo;), which, after they have properly understood it, will then result in them being saved. But I feel that this is something of a leap in logic.\nCan I change the scene a bit in order to illustrate how I feel that this is a leap in logic? Suppose that I tell my children that I have deposited $1,000 into the bank accounts of each of my grandchildren, and I want my children to pass on that good news to the grandchildren. There is nothing in what I have said which clearly states that my grandchildren will not get the $1,000 if their parents fail to tell them that I have given it to them. The money has already been given to them. It\u0026rsquo;s sitting there in their bank accounts right now. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that they may never check their bank account if they don\u0026rsquo;t know that it is there, but it would still be there. Of course it would certainly be helpful for them to know ahead of time that it is sitting there waiting for them, so that they can start drawing on it right now. But the bottom line is that I have the right and the ability to give them the money totally at my own discretion (with or without co-operation from my children in telling them), and the money only came because of my love for them. The gift is not dependent on whether or not my children ever tell them about it.\nCan you see how this contradicts what you are saying about all of the instructions in the Bible about preaching the gospel? You are saying that these commands about preaching the gospel necessarily say that there is no salvation for anyone until and unless they have been preached to by someone like you or me. That makes their salvation contingent upon our works, which I think is contrary to the whole spirit of the gospel. As I understand it, their salvation comes entirely at the discretion of God himself. He has given us the exciting task of telling people about what he has done; but it has been done whether or not we ever tell them.\nJesus tells a story about the day of judgment and says there will be a lot of people who will be totally surprised to be rewarded, and they will say, \u0026ldquo;When did we ever do something for you?\u0026rdquo; and he will say, \u0026ldquo;Inasmuch as you did it unto one of the least of these, my brothers, you did it unto me.\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 25:40) This seems to be an accurate picture of someone discovering the money in the bank account only after they get to heaven. But the point is that they still get there. It is not our job to give them their salvation, but only to inform them of what has already been done through the blood of Christ.\nThe Jews wanted to believe that they had a monopoly on God, and that the world could not know God without coming through them. This bothered God, and he wanted to teach the world that this is not true. But what you seem to be saying is that God booted out the Jews and then replaced them with yet another institution, and that the new institution was made equally indispensable as his instrument of salvation. You seem to be saying that unless you or I or someone like us acts as the mediator for the people of the world, they are eternally lost.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think Paul would agree with you. After all, he himself was brought to Christ through direct revelation, or a voice from heaven. God could see that Paul was sincere (i.e. that he was acting in genuine faith, even though he was doing the absolute wrong thing, by persecuting Christians) and so God stopped Paul in his tracks and set him straight. That is a good example of what I am saying about someone being saved on the basis of their sincerity and faith, and not on the basis of their doctrinal understanding of certain key passages from the Bible.\nActually, Abraham is an even better example. He never did \u0026ldquo;accept Christ\u0026rdquo; and he wasn\u0026rsquo;t even a Jew. He was basically a \u0026ldquo;heathen\u0026rdquo; in every sense of the word, and yet he was saved. In Romans 2:14, Paul says that when the heathen do by nature the things that are taught in the Bible, then they do not need the Bible to be saved. They are responding to the voice of God in their own heart\u0026hellip; like Abraham did. Abraham is praised as the ultimate example of faith (Romans 4:1-3), and yet he never heard of Christ, and presumably was never \u0026ldquo;born again\u0026rdquo; in the way that most people understand being born again today. But he was saved by the sacrificial death of Jesus.\nCan you see how he would have been saved, i.e. been a \u0026ldquo;Christian\u0026rdquo; without actually having a full understanding of the facts? And do you see how this is perfectly consistent with the verse that says Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and that no one comes to the Father except through him? (John 14:6) Abraham was only saved through Jesus\u0026rsquo; sacrificial death; but it was not necessary for him to understand all of that in order for God to do the work.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s get back to all of those commands about preaching the gospel. We believe very much in that. Every member of our community works full-time preaching the gospel in all the world. There are only a few of us, but we have travelled all over the world sharing our faith. We do not do it because we are trying to save people from hell, but we do it because we are trying to save people from the frustration, confusion, and depression that can come from being a sincere believer in God in the midst of a corrupt and unbelieving world. In other words, we do not try to turn goats into sheep. They are sheep already before we locate them. But they are \u0026ldquo;lost\u0026rdquo; in the sense that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand how they fit into God\u0026rsquo;s overall plan of salvation for the world. We take the good news of the teachings of Jesus to them, to encourage them in their faith. See? It\u0026rsquo;s good news\u0026hellip; right from the start. The good news (for the sincere and believing) is that they are saved\u0026hellip; already. Like my children telling their children the good news that the money is right there in their bank account. The money was there before they shared the good news, but the grandchildren just did not know about it. It is only religious pride on the part of the preacher that would try to make people think that they could not have been saved without the efforts of the preacher.\nIt may be tempting to extend the illustration of the bank deposits and say that the grandchildren cannot receive their inheritance unless they put in some kind of a claim for it, and they cannot put in a claim for it if they do not know that it is there in the bank waiting for them, and so, on that basis, they will never receive the inheritance without their parents telling them that it is there for them. But that extension of the illustration is not backed up in the gospels. No one ever had to take legal action against God to collect their salvation. You don\u0026rsquo;t make a \u0026ldquo;claim\u0026rdquo; to get salvation. It\u0026rsquo;s there. No ritual prayer needed. Technically, I don\u0026rsquo;t think they even had to say thank you, although it\u0026rsquo;s probably likely to be the first reaction when they really believe our good news. The problem in the church world today is that we are afraid to make it that free, and so we evangelicals have devised this clever little ritual prayer, which only confuses the matter.\nAnd now let\u0026rsquo;s go on to the commands of Jesus. You have rightly argued that God wants us to introduce people to the Jesus of the Bible, so that they can obey the Gospel. Everything that Jesus said indicates that he intends for us to obey the things that he commanded his followers to do. It is not enough to just tell people that Jesus is the Son of God and that he died for their sins. He wants us to \u0026ldquo;teach them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 28:19-20) I think we agree on that.\nNotice that, at the end of his sermon on the mount, Jesus told the story of the wise man and the foolish man. The foolish man actually heard the teachings of Jesus. In other words, someone \u0026ldquo;preached the gospel\u0026rdquo; to him, introduced him not only to Jesus but also to Jesus\u0026rsquo; teachings. And yet the foolish man did not obey the teachings of Jesus. The wise man, on the other hand, did obey the teachings of Jesus. (Matthew 7:24-27)\nAt the same time that I offer the heathen the message that it only takes faith in God for them to be saved, I expect that if they have faith in God, they will respond in obedience to the teachings of his Son. Of course, I expect the same thing from those who profess to believe that Jesus is the Son of God too\u0026hellip; only more so. To whom much has been given, much shall be required.\nBut what is the church doing with the teachings of Jesus? It\u0026rsquo;s handy to be able to damn the rest of the world to hell because they are not following Jesus. But what if we are not following him ourselves? If you really think that we must teach the heathen to obey Jesus, that\u0026rsquo;s fine. But if you don\u0026rsquo;t teach the same thing to the rest of the church, then you are worse than a heretic. You are a hypocrite.\nI suggest that you read Many Paths Up the Mountain, What is Faith?, Another Cornerstone, and What is a Christian? if you want to get a fuller picture of what we believe it means to be a Christian. Hopefully you will be pleasantly surprised to discover that we believe very strongly in the passages that you quoted in your letter. The only disappointment (which we hope and pray will not be a disappointment to you) could be that we also believe that the church world must take those verses more seriously if they hope to be saved.\nChristian love and peace,\nDave, for Jesus Christians\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/a-war-against-all-power/","title":"All Power Corrupts","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/pamu/Corrupt_hu_588baf7c8b0fea91.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"313\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/pamu\\/Corrupt_hu_1c3fc0b5b337816a.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/pamu/Corrupt_hu_29e8ef43b64b9c5d.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/pamu\\/Corrupt_hu_1ed5d1d1777e96eb.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Leadership","tags":"Power, Wisdom","content":"\u0026ldquo;Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.\u0026rdquo;\n--John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton (1834–1902)\nThis quotation from the 19th Century British historian and moralist, John Acton, has been one that has interested and followed me all of my life. As a young adult, I felt that it was too cynical, and it did not allow for the goodness that is in people. One reason for my rejection of the quote may have been that I never realised that the words \u0026ldquo;tends to\u0026rdquo; were part of the quotation, and so I had assumed that it was an absolute statement (as expressed in the title of this article).\nHowever, as I have grown older and observed, not only others, but also myself, I have come to see that the saying, even in its more extreme form (i.e. \u0026ldquo;All power corrupts\u0026rdquo;) is fairly accurate, and it is consistent with the doctrine of the \u0026ldquo;fallen nature of man\u0026rdquo;. We human beings have a tendency to mess everything up without desperate prayer and humble dependence on God.\nThe most common way that this happens (in my experience) is that when we do something good, we receive recognition for it, which translate as \u0026ldquo;authority\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; authority, based on experience. The more good that we do, the more authority/power that we receive. And that \u0026ldquo;authority\u0026rdquo; can easily be taken as license to ignore our own faults and focus on the faults of others. People will allow us to do that if we have been fair in our dealings up to that point. And the more fair we have been, the more authority/recognition/freedom/power we will have received and thus be capable of abusing.\nIf there is any part of the quotation at the start of this article which I would object to, it would be the last part, the part that is usually left out: \u0026ldquo;Great men are almost always bad men.\u0026rdquo; It would be better to say that we are all \u0026ldquo;bad men\u0026rdquo; (whether generally regarded as \u0026ldquo;great\u0026rdquo; or not). For some of us, that badness comes out very quickly; others see it; and then they cease to give us the recognition that they go on to give to those who are more successful in taming their corruption. So in many ways, the \u0026ldquo;great\u0026rdquo; leaders are those who have been able to overcome this \u0026ldquo;fallen nature of man\u0026rdquo; for a little longer than the rest of us. It is just that when they do fall (if they are going to) they will have more opportunity to do harm because of the increased power that they have received.\nWe need leaders, at the same time that we see leadership abused every day. But if we see this as a problem that all of us (whether leaders or followers) are struggling with, then there may be more hope for us all.\nReligion has often been accused of preying on the guilts of others in order to maintain control over the masses. There is some truth in this, but there is a dilemma as well, in that true spiritual leadership does need to confront those guilts and it needs to fairly represent God\u0026rsquo;s position. Both the love of God and the justice of God need to be communicated to the world. But they need to be communicated in ways that are not biased toward the \u0026ldquo;voice in the wilderness\u0026rdquo; that a true spiritual leader needs to be. As John the Baptist (the original \u0026ldquo;voice in the wilderness\u0026rdquo;) once said, \u0026ldquo;He (Jesus) must increase, and I must decrease.\u0026rdquo;\nThe prosperity preachers and other calvinistic ministries have achieved a lot of success and popularity for themselves by telling people what they wanted to hear about the \u0026ldquo;love\u0026rdquo; of God, i.e. that God wants only to make them healthy, wealthy, and popular. This, to me, is a corruption of the truth. But by the same token, the hellfire and brimstone ministries appeal to people\u0026rsquo;s desire to be righteously superior to others whether or not we really ARE superior in God\u0026rsquo;s eyes. Condemnation, whether it be of the congregation or of the clergy, represents, to me, yet another form of corruption.\nSo, whether we are taking a soft line (\u0026ldquo;God loves you.\u0026rdquo;) or a hard line (\u0026ldquo;God is not happy with what you are doing.\u0026rdquo;) and whether we are talking down to the masses from the pulpit of leadership, or responding to leadership from the congregation, we are going to encounter opportunities to corrupt the power that we have. Flattery and condemnation both are abuses of power. If we ignore this, as so many of us do, then we do so to our own spiritual detriment.\nHaving recognised that we all have power, and that we are all prone to abusing this power, the big question is how do we reverse this tendency? I think it can only be reversed through prayer. By that, I mean that in the secret place, between ourselves and our own conscience, we need to resolve to confront abuse in our own lives whenever we see it, with God\u0026rsquo;s help. If we can see that yesterday\u0026rsquo;s success at confronting our own corruption only increases our freedom to be more corrupt today, that may be of some help too.\nEver vigilant. Ever faithful. It is a never-ending battle, and it is one that can only be fought in the secrecy of our prayer closet, where we ignore everyone else\u0026rsquo;s faults except our own.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/amazing-grace/","title":"Amazing Grace","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/AmazingG_hu_79c5b38020ad3561.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/AmazingG_hu_713328f332642b2d.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/AmazingG_hu_4a193cd5b5be9818.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/AmazingG_hu_cd350b08a6ee4637.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Churches and Theology","tags":"Doctrine, Theology, Grace","content":"It is easy to assume that people have already heard about God\u0026rsquo;s grace through the churches. But on closer inspection, it appears that the churches themselves do not believe the gospel they preach.\nThe facts are fairly simple: Nobody is perfect, and we all find it easier to be bad than to be good. Even our \u0026lsquo;goodness\u0026rsquo; usually leads to pride, self-righteousness, and hypocrisy. God really wants us to be good; but he sees that we cannot change in our own strength.\nSo, to impress on us the seriousness of sin and the depths of his love, he sent his Son, Jesus, to live a life of perfect love, then to suffer a cruel death. His death became the payment for all sins of the world: past, present, and future!\nGod still wants us to be good, but he wants us to act out of love and not out of fear. You have been forgiven for all the wrongs you ever have or ever will commit. That is how much God loves you.\nThis grace is freely given to everyone\u0026hellip; regardless of religious affiliation or level of sinfulness. The only thing that limits it is your willingness to believe it.\nBut be careful that you are not confusing belief in God with belief in a loophole. The grace of God is for those who really want to do what is right, but who realise that they fall far short of this. When you really believe that God is so loving, you will respond in love and obedience. (See Smile, God Loves You!)\nThe reason we say the churches do not believe this, is because they continue to restrict God\u0026rsquo;s grace.\nThey say it is only given to people who perform some religious ritual, or who subscribe to the correct theology. The ritual may be circumcision, baptism, or saying a prescribed prayer. And the theology ultimately includes wilful disobedience to Jesus.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s only the start. They put new disciplines and taboos onto people\u0026hellip; rules that have little or nothing to do with the teachings of Jesus\u0026hellip; health rules, rules about church attendance, etc. etc.\nWe too say that God expects to see a change in the way we live when we realise that he loves us. But the change should be a natural response to his love (not a desperate attempt to prove our righteousness), and it should be in accordance with God\u0026rsquo;s requirements and not the requirements of a religion.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t let religious people make you feel condemned; just believe that you have been put right with God through the sacrificial death of Jesus. The more you believe it, the more you will just naturally want to know more about Jesus, and to obey him. It will change your life. The more you believe that God loves you, the more you will believe that the disciplines of Christ\u0026rsquo;s teachings are good news too.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to say a prayer, join a church, or even call yourself a Christian to earn God\u0026rsquo;s forgiveness. It\u0026rsquo;s a simple fact that you just have to believe to receive.\nIf you like, you can say \u0026lsquo;Thank you\u0026rsquo; to God for this new freedom. But even that isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary.

For that reason, I would like to discuss them together in the same article, starting first with anarchy, and then bringing pacifism into it a bit later.\nUnfortunately, anarchy (which literally means government by no one) has suffered from a bad image in the minds of the uninitiated. The general public pictures a Charles Manson \u0026ldquo;helter-skelter\u0026rdquo; world full of hate and chaos when they hear the word anarchy; but this is not what most anarchists picture when they use the word. Some of the world\u0026rsquo;s most \u0026ldquo;together\u0026rdquo; people have given the concept of anarchy serious consideration. Leo Tolstoy, for example, was regarded as an anarchist. And many people today who do not think of themselves as anarchists would almost certainly embrace at least some of the ideals which serious anarchists espouse.\nFor the sincere anarchist, the goal is a world where each individual takes personal responsibility for his or her own actions. Evil is not controlled through punishment, but rather through the sterling example of genuine goodness that radiates from the anarchists themselves. Tolstoy saw this radical approach to justice epitomised in the words of Jesus when he said: \u0026ldquo;Resist not evil; but render good for evil.\u0026rdquo;\nThis concept of dealing with evil only through personal goodness forms the link between anarchy and pacifism.\nMany anarchists see peaceful forms of civil disobedience and active nonviolence as effective ways to change the world. Gandhi\u0026rsquo;s movement in India to rid the country of the British, and Martin Luther King\u0026rsquo;s civil rights movement for African Americans in the United States both used these techniques. But all of these movements were somewhat beaten to the punch by the early Quakers, who were pioneers in the area of equal rights for all, regardless of race, religion, or sex.\nThe ideals of anarchy and pacifism are reflected today in much of the New Age movement and other left-wing political movements. There is amongst all of these people a strong yearning for world peace and a new utopian age of personal accountability.\nUnfortunately, there are also some problems with this approach, and it is toward these problems that I would now want to direct attention.\nWe have discovered that, if the devil cannot get us to avoid obedience to Jesus, he will often take some teaching of Jesus and try to get us to extend it in such a way as to blind us to how that teaching fits in with the rest of what Jesus taught. For example, it is extremely rare to find anyone who is willing to forsake all that they own and to live by faith. But of those we have met who tried living by faith, many have become convinced that they must never ask for help or ask for money when they are in need. They argue that God should bring the provisions to them without any effort on their part. God certainly can do such a thing; and in our own experience he often has. It is commendable that people should at least be willing to consider such a step. However, there is nothing in the teachings of Jesus to forbid people asking for help.\nIn fact, quite the opposite is true. Jesus taught, \u0026ldquo;When you go to a town, ask who is worthy, and stay with that person, eating whatever they provide; for a worker is worthy to receive such payment.\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 10:11 and Luke 10:7)\nWhile some people have become disillusioned because provision did not come without asking, others have become self-righteous because provision did come without them having to ask. It is so easy to demand that others follow an ideal that Jesus never required them to follow, especially when they find that ideal working for themselves. But we must be careful about putting heavy burdens on other people that Jesus never asked them to carry.\nA similar problem can arise with regard to anarchy. The anarchist can become like the \u0026ldquo;nondenominational\u0026rdquo; Christian, who insists that only the other guys are \u0026ldquo;denominations\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; that their particular division is something quite different from the other divisions. Anarchists can become proud of the fact that they have no government, no leaders, no rules, no accountability, no discipline, and (presumably) no self-righteousness. But what we end up with is a choice between someone who is (at least liable to being) proud of what they do, and someone who is (at least liable to being) proud of what they do not do. You do not escape the risk of being proud, self-righteous, or passing judgment just by espousing anarchy.\nGovernment by no one is still government, and we must examine how well it works in comparison to such things as government by the people (democracy), government by God (theocracy), government by a king (monarchy), government by a dictator (autocracy), etc. Did Tolstoy, for example, do more good for God and for the world than did the Anabaptists, who established churches and thus became the target of opposing political forces? Tolstoy lived to a ripe old age, while the Anabaptists were sought out and executed; and Tolstoy was able to do this at least partly because he was able to assure his enemies that he was not building an empire to rival their own. Peasants were encouraged to just stay humble little peasants, working hard for their masters and not upsetting the status quo. Tolstoy even boasted that people who lived like that would be well-liked by all. But this is not what Jesus taught.\nTolstoy argued convincingly against Christian support for the courts of the world, on the grounds that we should not \u0026ldquo;judge\u0026rdquo; others. But in his arguing, he himself passed scathing judgments on the government and the church of his day. We would be inclined to take a similar position, i.e. we judge the churches and governments of the world as being counterfeits of the perfect government that God wishes to establish in each of our hearts. But we must not forget that the line between righteous judgment and self-righteous (or downright evil) judgment is not always clear.\nAnd that is where the pacifists come in. They offer a simple method of delineation between the physical and the spiritual, between what they regard as evil judgment and what they regard as legitimate or righteous judgment. If you physically touch, injure, or kill another person, they say, your judgment is wrong, and should be deplored. The atrocities of war and the execution of criminals are seen as the worst examples of judgment, and pacifists attack these en toto, regardless of the extenuating circumstances. There is no comparison, they believe, between judgment of that nature and the judgment that they are exercising in condemning it.\nBut here is a trap that many idealists fall into. If you can demonise the opposition (in this case, the military and the courts), it can serve as a convenient cover for the demons that lurk within your own heart. Jesus taught that the real sin was not violence or even murder, but rather the hatred and bitterness that seems to affect all of us.\nIt is so easy to tell the Albanians to love the Serbs who have just raped and murdered their mothers and fathers, their sisters and brothers, or their daughters and sons. And it is easy to tell the Serbs to do the same thing with regard to the ethnic cleansing that they were subjected to prior to the latest war. But what are we doing about our own hurts and differences? It is absolutely right when anyone says that the answer in Yugoslavia lies in turning the other cheek, in forgiving past sins, in constructive dialogue and unity. But it is too easy to be smug in condemning them for their lack of Christian virtue when we haven\u0026rsquo;t even begun to appreciate just how much patience they have each shown already. It could be that we are guilty of the worst possible hypocrisy if we try to judge them for their bitterness when we have bitterness in our own hearts over some of the most trivial injustices, some of which may even be entirely imaginary.\nBy all means, let us encourage the pacifist ideals of loving our enemies; and even more so, let us endeavour to practise those ideals, not only with our enemies, but also with our brothers and sisters in Christ. But let us go very lightly on preaching them to a world that has yet to see us practise ourselves what we are so quick to demand from them.\nThe truth is the truth (i.e. the truth about the need for more humility, patience, love, and forgiveness), but how we present it can make all the difference. Jesus did not see a simple black and white line between physical violence and spiritual violence. For him, the enemy was just as real in someone who would shout obscenities at his brother as they were in someone who would open fire with a machine gun. In fact, everything about Christ\u0026rsquo;s life seemed to indicate that he saw the honest open aggression of a warring nation (e.g. the Romans) to be less abhorrent than the pious cover-up of a warring (pharisaical) heart.\nI recently read something which seemed to be saying that one of the key planks in the Quaker program for world peace is a very strong world government under the auspices of the United Nations. Many years of experience have shown the Quakers that real peace requires discipline of one sort or another.\nIn the years before the U.S. Civil War a great many people aligned themselves with the Quakers as professed pacifists. Then, when war actually broke out, the others almost all fell away. They could not resist taking up weapons when they saw no other way to stop the evil of slavery. The Quakers, on the other hand, almost all stayed faithful to their commitment to peace. Peace was not just a shallow fad for them, but something which they had learned through bitter experience would require extreme discipline on their part.\nUnfortunately, there are disturbing signs that present-day Quaker commitment to peace has, at least for many, been accompanied by a lack of commitment to Jesus. Like so many others in the churches, they have fallen away from the kind of Christian discipline that their early founders had, and it has led to them advocating a form of discipline (i.e. a strong world government, overseen by the U.N.) which we believe (according to our understanding of Bible prophecy) will lead to the worst suffering the world has ever known. If people will not choose to be disciplined by God, they will eventually be disciplined by the god of this world. There is in the peace movement (and the anarchy that accompanies it) enough deception to make some believe that they are preaching the gospel of Christ when they may really be preaching the gospel of antichrist. We must learn to tell the difference.\nThere are four insidious lies which I believe have contributed to the perversion that now exists in the peace movement. They must be addressed in our own lives if we are not to be swept away spiritually by them. Remember, that these perversions do not detract from the genuine truths that led to the peace movement in the first place. However, the Bible says that when the world says \u0026ldquo;Peace!\u0026rdquo; sudden destruction will come upon it. (1 Thessalonians 5:3) If we do not deal with these four lies personally and seriously, \u0026ldquo;sudden destruction\u0026rdquo; may be the end result for us as individuals as well.\nLIE NO. 1: Pain is evil. This lie overlooks the fact that pain is the body\u0026rsquo;s way of telling us that something is wrong. An alarm in a car or in a shop is not evil, even if the thief who breaks in is. The alarm is our way of becoming aware of the real evil and dealing with it. When children (or adults) are punished in some physical way, the pain they experience is meant to get their attention, and to tell them that something is wrong, i.e. that something needs to change. There are other ways to generate this awareness besides inflicting pain; but inflicting pain is one option, and should not be universally ruled out. In fact, physical pain inflicted in love will often do less damage to the individual than what could result from insensitive use of words, or worse still, from simple neglect.\nLIE NO. 2: Discipline is evil. Horror stories about parents who punish their children, and about organisations that require members to meet certain standards are used to support the present trend against all discipline. The real issue for us as Christians should not be whether or not a person or group exercises discipline, but rather it should be whether the overall goals of the discipline were in keeping with the will of God, or whether they were contrary to the will of God. If we will not examine discipline along these lines, we will end up condemning God himself for making demands of his children and for punishing those who fail to meet his demands.\nLIE NO. 3: Life is God. It is the nature of the \u0026ldquo;creature\u0026rdquo; to cling to life with all that is in us. However, the Creator has told us that there is something greater than this life if we will just learn to let go of what we cling to so desperately now. (See Romans 1:25.) People die every day, and God rarely intervenes, even though he could if he wanted to. He does not act because death, to him, is more or less a myth. We must be careful about letting our natural revulsion at death make us condemn anything that leads to someone\u0026rsquo;s death. Was it Socrates who said, \u0026ldquo;Not life, but a good life is to be chiefly valued\u0026rdquo;?\nLIE NO. 4: Power is evil. It is easy for the cynic to believe that \u0026ldquo;all power corrupts\u0026rdquo;, but even if that were true, it would not prove that power itself is evil. The truth is that God himself is both all-powerful and all-good. And he desperately seeks people who can use the power and authority he wants to give them in a fair and loving way. A war against all power is a war against God.\nThe anarchist philosophy is a convenient means of escape from our responsibility to exercise authority over others (and also a convenient means of escape from our need to respect God\u0026rsquo;s authority in others). Every part of our life is made meaningful and productive through organisation. There is no one who is totally free from organisation, and those who are most disorganised are generally sad specimens of humanity. People like George Fox (who is credited with having founded Quakerism), Leo Tolstoy, Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and Jesus Christ were very organised and disciplined people. They each exercised a great deal of authority in their own way, and led many people as a result.\nAnyone who has ever achieved anything truly worthwhile on earth has done so through such discipline. We can react to the abuses of power that we see all around us, by running away from responsibility and sending others away to \u0026ldquo;follow their own conscience\u0026rdquo;, but the bottom line is whether we have done that in faith and obedience to Jesus, or whether we have only reacted in fear and, thus, become instruments of the devil.\nWe believe that Jesus will soon return to judge the earth with a rod of iron. Blood will flow in the streets when he begins to carry out his judgment on this planet. (Revelation 14:19-20) He is recruiting an army of people who are willing to follow him into that battle\u0026hellip; not a battle for any earthly government, but a battle for his heavenly government. Are we willing to train now to be a part of that army?\nIn summary, we have discovered that there is no perfect government here on earth, and that includes anarchy. There will always be abuses in whatever system we choose, and a philosophy that incorporates anarchist and/or pacifist principles will not act as a sufficient safeguard against such abuse. The bottom line must be our own willingness to follow God in whatever direction he may choose. Unless we can deal with the sources of evil in our own hearts, these philosophies will prove to be just as ineffectual in overcoming evil as any other.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/bottom-squezing/","title":"Bottom Squeezers","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/lefto/BottomSq_hu_353ca60804f09cb6.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/lefto\\/BottomSq_hu_e95ab094bfefdf13.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/lefto/BottomSq_hu_7428e3643e6b36ed.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/lefto\\/BottomSq_hu_e62ce5415db2d01a.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Leftovers","tags":"Guidance, Random","content":"Some of us squeeze toothpaste from the middle, and some squeeze it from the bottom. Bottom squeezers would like the world to follow their example; but middle squeezers argue that such obsession with order infringes on their spontaneous individuality.\nIf it was just a matter of bottom squeezers having to occasionally press out wrinkles caused by the middle squeezers, it would not be all that important. But habits in one area often reflect themselves in other areas; and middle squeezing could relate to other problems. Someone has to remove forks and spoons from between stacks of dirty plates, scrape the last of the peanut butter from the jar, and just generally work around others who grab the best bits and who only do the easy tasks.\nIf you find yourself taking the best and leaving the scraps for others (something that happens far more often when people are living in community like ourselves and sharing everything from towels to push-bikes), then you may need to consider the spiritual benefits of straightening up (e.g. squeezing from the bottom) after others occasionally instead of always leaving others to pick up after you.\nThe Bible says, \u0026ldquo;Let everything be done decently and in order.\u0026rdquo; (1 Corinthians 14:40) Little things like having a place for scissors and a place for towels and a place for pens, and always putting them in their place, definitely make life easier for those who come after you.\nThe Methodists received their name because they were noted for being methodical in everything that they did. Today there is widespread paranoia of schedules and conformity; but textbooks on business management still teach that things like budgets, desk calendars, meeting agendas, etc. are some of the most important steps toward running an efficient business.\nA good leader learns to delegate tasks to subordinates. But you cannot delegate tasks which only you can understand. The more that you can organise tasks into simple, clear-cut responsibilities which can be quickly understood by anyone attempting them, the more you can delegate them with confidence that they will be carried out, and the more contented will be those to whom you delegate them.\nThe much-maligned assembly line is an example of this. Despite the problems associated with repetitive tasks, most workers prefer jobs which have objectively measurable expectations associated with them; and assembly lines are often like this.\nAn overly broad list of responsibilities without clear guidelines as to how they should be carried out only causes confusion. Even executives often give in to the temptation to do such simple jobs, simply because they are simple (and thus more enjoyable), rather than delegating them to subordinates.\nTurning all your currency to face in the same direction in the cash box or in your wallet, with small notes on the top and big ones on the bottom, may take more effort than just stuffing all the money into a jar; but when it comes time to tally up (or to make change quickly) the benefits become obvious.\nIn the same way, neat financial records, a tidy desk, clear notes on business meetings, and an up-to-date bulletin board all make life easier for yourself as well as for those around you.\nIt may be harder to see the point in having a tidy bedroom or garden, socks hanging together on the clothes line, or matching chairs in the lounge room; but even these kind of details add something to the well-being of people entering your premises. They sense a spirit of order even when they cannot put a name to it.\n\u0026ldquo;Babylon\u0026rsquo; means confusion. We hope to replace Babylon with the tranquillity of the kingdom of heaven. Many who visit us are in a state of confusion. They live lives of quiet desperation. In the midst of their spiritual anarchy we can offer a haven of peace that comes from doing every little task \u0026ldquo;decently and in order\u0026rdquo;.. even down to how we squeeze our toothpaste!\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/redeem-the-time/","title":"Buying Time","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/TurnTime_hu_d336ce4b91e3f1c0.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/TurnTime_hu_be2d6e3303c6f5d9.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/TurnTime_hu_eb95e3fbed5beeab.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/TurnTime_hu_471342ca7f59cf26.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Inspirational","tags":"Guidance","content":"Time is life. When you give your time to a person or thing, you are giving your life. When you \u0026ldquo;kill time\u0026rdquo;, you are destroying your life. When you use time well, you are using your life well.\nGod gives us life, but the devil tries to destroy life. (John 10:10) God said to Adam and Eve that they would die if they disobeyed him. (Genesis 2:17) But after eating the fruit that God said they must not eat, they did not stop breathing. What happened is that they stopped living the full life that they had lived before they disobeyed God. After they disobeyed God, their lives were controlled by fear. (Genesis 3:16-19) The devil argues that this is not death. (Genesis 3:4) But it is not the full life that God wants to give us. (John 10:10)\nIn many ways, sleep is like death. (1 Corinthians 11:30) When we sleep, we do not think of time. We stop almost all moving and thinking. It is very important for us to have some sleep, because it is a time when God fixes many things in our spirit and in our thinking. After a good sleep, we should be able to work and think much better. But people who do not have a reason for living (see Learning to See, part 1) often do not want to stop sleeping. (Proverbs 21:25) If we can give these people a reason for living, we can bring them back from the dead. (Ephesians 5:14)\nJesus has given us a reason for living. He shows us how God wants us to use our time. Because of this, we no longer want to throw away the smallest part of the time that we have received from God. (Ephesians 5:15-16)\nThe first step in using your time well is to listen to God. (Ephesians 5:17) If you are doing something, but you do not know why you are doing it, you are not fully alive. (Romans 14:23) All that you do should help you to become closer to God. (Colossians 3:17, 23) We can learn to listen to God at all times (even in our sleep). (I Thessalonians 5:17) If you do not know what God wants you to do, you should ask him, and he will tell you. (James 1:5) If you do this, and if you do it all the time, you will be able to hear God at any time. When you go to sleep, you will be listening to God, and in your sleep you will know that God is with you. At times, God will talk to you in a spiritual dream. (Acts 2:17)\nThe devil has many ways to destroy our lives. He can kill our time by encouraging us to use drugs that will put our minds to sleep. (Ephesians 5:18-19) He can destroy our time by making us foolish. (Proverbs 19:3)\nMost people throw away most of their lives, by spending it in fear\u0026hellip; fear of being without money\u0026hellip; fear of what other people think of them\u0026hellip; fear of going hungry\u0026hellip; fear of dying. They use their time to work for money because of these fears. They are not free to do what God wants them to do because they fear that God will tell them to do something that will take them away from the god that they really serve, and that is Money. (Romans 6:16) Working for money brings them death; but working for love would bring them eternal life. (Romans 6:23; Luke 16:13)\nThe devil can destroy our time by making us turn our brains off and by making us just \u0026ldquo;space out\u0026rdquo;. Some people make a religion of this way of dying. Like sleep, it is good to rest; but the reason for resting is so that you can live, and not the other way around.\nSome Pentecostals encourage people to turn off their brains and to fall on the ground. They call it \u0026ldquo;dying in the spirit\u0026rdquo;. It is a good name, because it is what happens to them. What they do not understand is that God does not want people to die; it is the devil who does that. When people make a religion out of turning off their brains, they become more and more crazy in all of their thinking. (Romans 1:28)\nIt can be difficult to wake up our brains, and to return to the truth. The devil in us fights against this. (Luke 8:28) And the crazy world around us is afraid of a person who is not crazy like them. (Luke 8:35-37) But if we will ask God to help us, he will teach us how to use our brains for him. (2 Timothy 1:7) Our brains can be \u0026ldquo;born again\u0026rdquo;. (Romans 12:2) When this happens, we will start to see clearly the needs of people around us. We will try to use every minute wisely, to make a new world of love.\nIf you measure what you are doing, you will know if you are using your time wisely. We often run races and we measure how long it takes us to finish. In short races, one second can make a big difference. (1 Corinthians 9:26-27) In life, it is the person who uses his or her time well who will do the most for God.\nLearn to fill every second with life. When you are tired from doing something physical, you should do something that uses your brain. And when you are tired of using your brain, you should do something physical. If you must wait for something, or if you must sit for a long time when travelling, use the time to study your Bible or to study some verse cards. (You should carry one or both of these with you at all times.) If you cannot study, you can use your time to pray and ask God to tell you what he wants you to do. Do not wait for someone to tell you what you should be doing with your time. Always ask God first.\nWhen you do this, you will be buying back the life that the devil robbed from Adam and Eve by encouraging them to disobey God.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/character/","title":"Character","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/deep/Karakter_hu_85355a9fd4acbd.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"315\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/deep\\/Karakter_hu_b41d511b247995a5.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/deep/Karakter_hu_fe6bc5ecea9631c3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/deep\\/Karakter_hu_8a394add47e9eaa7.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Deep Thoughts","tags":"Guidance","content":"What ever happened to good old-fashioned character?\nThe world is full of friendly, polite, helpful\u0026hellip; outwardly very nice people. But in the midst of adversity, when \u0026rsquo;niceness\u0026rsquo; is really needed, how much remains?\nI asked a nurse who was defending all the nice people in her church, how many of them were willing to actually give their lives for her; and she answered, \u0026ldquo;When it comes to that, I suppose none of them are.\u0026rdquo;\nShe went further and confessed that she did not even know one that would give her their car (which she badly needed to get to work at that time).\nThe test of character is not how one behaves when things are going smoothly, but rather, how one behaves when faced with ultimate life-and-death priorities.\nThe great evils of the world are not carried out by red-faced demons. They are carried out by people who are on the whole, good neighbours, respectable churchgoers, successful businesspeople, faithful marriage partners\u0026hellip; but who have never found anything worth dying for.\nConsequently, whenever faced with choices between the virtues they profess and losing their jobs, their reputations, their possessions, or their life, they simply let go of the virtues \u0026rsquo;temporarily\u0026rsquo;, until the danger is past.\nMulti-national corporations that rape the environment and exploit the Third World are really just groups of nice shareholders and nice employees like you and me.\nGovernments that oppress minorities and practice corruption are composed of people who would have no trouble gaining character references from their friends.\nAbortionists, tobacco advertisers, producers of pornography, bookies, criminal lawyers\u0026hellip; they are all just out to make a living in the best way they can\u0026hellip; the same as you and me. And if you get to know them, you\u0026rsquo;ll find they are basically pretty nice people in the day to day trivialities of life.\nUntil we can see that evil lurks in each of us under the cloak of our best self-image, we will be powerless to combat evil. The Enemy is happy to let us talk ideals, as long as he knows that, in the crunch, our ideals will collapse under the excuse of being \u0026lsquo;realistic\u0026rsquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;Character\u0026rdquo; was a word I heard often when growing up. But today even the thought of a person being committed to an ideal strongly enough to die for it is suss. Young people are no longer told to develop character. Instead, they\u0026rsquo;re told to love themselves, to survive, to get ahead, to look out for Number One.\nIn the face of all this, we as Christians wish to declare our commitment to building character\u0026hellip; whether or not it works (since commitment to ideals in the face of failure is the essence of character anyway). We will try to do and to say what is right simply because it is right, and to do our best to accept the punishment society hands out to such fanatics.\nWe are looking for others who do the same.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/christian-science/","title":"Christian Science","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/deep/Science_hu_7da7aaf41854d963.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"279\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/deep\\/Science_hu_583d87f1036ec8d1.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/deep/Science_hu_8f6a182bcfb6e09c.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/deep\\/Science_hu_9a723d9c08d861a6.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Deep Thoughts","tags":"Science","content":"In the book Life After Life, a doctor interviews hundreds of people who were clinically dead and then revived. He notes a number of patterns in their experiences. One of these patterns was a widespread conviction by many of these people as they were dying that what really matters in life is not how much money you earn, but how much you love others and how much you learn.\nThe love part seemed obvious to us; but the learning revelation caught us by surprise.\nAdvances in science have been traditionally regarded with suspicion by the church. If you consider how things like TVs, cars, nuclear energy, and silicon chips have altered human history, the suspicion is understandable. Even medical advances such as tranquillisers, test tube babies, and heart transplants have posed serious ethical dilemmas.\nSo is all learning necessarily good? And if not, how do we decide what to learn and what not to learn?\nJesus said, \u0026ldquo;I am\u0026hellip; the Truth.\u0026rdquo; (John 14:6) He promised to possess his followers with his \u0026ldquo;Spirit of Truth\u0026rdquo; after he ascended into heaven, and he said, \u0026ldquo;When the Spirit of Truth comes, he will guide you into all truth.\u0026rdquo; (John 16:13)\nOn the basis of this, we have concluded that all learning must be good. It seems reasonable to assume that evil only comes from misapplication of truth, or from an unwillingness to learn the whole truth.\nYou cannot tell the \u0026ldquo;whole truth\u0026rdquo; without bringing Jesus into it sooner or later. But neither can you tell the whole truth by restricting yourself to theology.\nTrue love and true learning must be two sides of the same coin.\nIf learning is not motivated by love, you will invariably mis-learn, limiting yourself to learning only what suits your selfish goals. On the other hand, true love is more than romance and emotionalism. It will seek answers that work\u0026hellip; for the good of all.\nTrue scientific method is consistent with this understanding of Christianity. It is built on such things as respect for past knowledge, and a willingness to question unproven dogmas in an effort to find the whole truth. There is no room for pride, greed, or fear to hide truth, nor is there room to promote something that is not true.\nObviously modern education has fallen far away from these ideals\u0026hellip; as has modern religion. But the answer is not to become simpletons\u0026hellip; any more than it is to become atheists. True science is the product of true Christianity; and we must seek to rediscover them both.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/convenient-doctrines/","title":"Convenient Doctrines","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/ConvienDoc_hu_74e5474bac3100c8.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"630\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/ConvienDoc_hu_881a47350ca7f729.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/ConvienDoc_hu_4ede71c4b7d40e98.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/ConvienDoc_hu_db40c2fa8c15903a.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Top Forty","tags":"Religion, Doctrine","content":"Most people have wondered at times at the number of strange and contradictory doctrines that circle the globe in the name of God. Religion is a mass of conflicting statements, a jungle too dense for most educated people these days to even consider seeking refuge in it. As soon as we become smart enough to examine even two churches or religions side by side, we see enough contradictions to know that they cannot both be right. And by the time that we have been through three or four, a doubt begins to grow that any of them could be right.\nWe assume that each of these groups is filled with sincere people who all arrived at different conclusions. If that\u0026rsquo;s what religious sincerity and faith in God are all about, then one is better off to stay right away from it. Such religion is no more reliable than one\u0026rsquo;s imagination.\nBut hold on a minute! What if they are not sincere? What if each religion is peopled with seekers after lies rather than seekers after truth? And what if the real seekers after truth all quite naturally grow progressively closer to one another?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what this article seeks to show.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t take much spiritual enlightenment to know that we all have certain selfish instincts. It should therefore be easy to see that these selfish instincts are often going to get in the way of our search for truth. The biggest hindrance to our search for Perfect Truth is a tendency to set up camp around some half truth. And sometimes these half-truths are distorted in ways that are quite blatantly dishonest when examined dispassionately. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a theologian to see that they have been turned into outright lies.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a non-religious example for starters, to show how it works. We said earlier that many non-religious people conclude that religion is pointless because there are so many different religions, and because they say so many contradictory things. But these people are doing exactly what the various religions are doing. They are making valid observations about the religions, but their conclusion is ludicrous.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t give up looking for gold just because there are so many worthless rocks in the ground. And you don\u0026rsquo;t stop seeking truth just because there are so many lies. Otherwise, you become a part of the lies. So atheism and the arguments put forward to defend it, become for the most part as much a \u0026ldquo;convenience doctrine\u0026rdquo; as are those doctrines put forward by counterfeit believers. Our selfish nature finds it inconvenient to seek out an understanding of and a relationship with our Creator, so we invent convenient teachings that say He/She/It doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, or that He/She/It is not worth bothering with. Whatever smaller truths may be built into the ideology, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t take a genius to see that the fundamental argument (that there is no Creator, or that the Creator can never be known) goes against all common sense in terms of causes and effects.\nNo one is stupid enough to believe that a bottle of Coke could just appear on a beach one morning as the result of a lot of natural coincidences (lightning storms, waves, wind, movements of rocks, etc.) which brought together paper, ink, glass, and plastic in just the right quantities and shapes to produce the bottle, at the same time that it brought together sugar, water, cola, and other ingredients in suitable quantities to fill the bottle just before the lid went on in a freaky little cyclone that sealed it tight. So why would anyone be stupid enough to believe that life, the universe, and everything made itself in the same way\u0026hellip; just naturally? You want to know why people believe such stuff?\nConvenience. Nothing more and nothing less. Just plain old simple convenience. People got tired of looking, and created a god in their own lazy, selfish image, and called it truth. Very convenient!\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what each of these conflicting religions has done. To be sure, there are bits of truth in all of them, and there have probably been, over time, sincere people (or at least relatively sincere people) in all of them too. But the end result is still a convenient package. Parts of the package exist for the convenience of the founders, and parts of the package exist for the convenience of the followers. And Truth suffers from both forms of convenience.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look a little more closely at so-called Christian doctrines. Would anyone in their right minds conclude after reading the New Testament that a fundamental reason for Jesus Christ coming to earth was to teach people how to become rich? Not spiritually rich, mind you, but dollars and cents rich, millionaire rich, filthy lucre rich. Yet that is one of the fastest growing and most widely spread teachings of so-called Christian denominations of all sorts today. Why? Because it\u0026rsquo;s so incredibly convenient. It sells like hot cakes. It fills churches. And it fills the collection plates. There are little gems of truth in what the gurus of gold teach, but the overall message is a lie.\nWould anyone reading the New Testament for the first time conclude that it was saying that people should stop trying to be good, because anyone who does so is guilty of trying to work their way to heaven? And would they conclude that God hates people trying to be good more than anything else? Of course not! And yet that teaching is even more widespread than the prosperity teaching. It, too, has some convenient proof texts to justify disobedience to anything else that the Bible teaches. But it is not the result of an honest attempt to understand what the Bible really does say. It\u0026rsquo;s just a convenient doctrine for lazy, selfish people who don\u0026rsquo;t want to be bothered with following the rules as Christ expressed them.\nThere are hundreds of other doctrines that operate in exactly the same way. Christ very clearly taught, for example, that divorced people should not remarry. Every married couple can see it. But it\u0026rsquo;s not a convenient doctrine for divorced people. So they just see what they want to see, and hey presto! whole books are written to say that remarriage after divorce is just fine. And as the number of divorcees continues to grow today, whole denominations are adopting the books as yet another convenient doctrine.\nSomeone has said that you can prove anything by the Bible. You can\u0026rsquo;t really. But you can pretend to prove anything by the Bible, and if what you are teaching is really appealing (read \u0026ldquo;convenient\u0026rdquo;) people won\u0026rsquo;t much care whether it is in the Bible or not. Any old pretext in the form of some obscure proof text will do. But it\u0026rsquo;s not because you have proven anything. It\u0026rsquo;s just because what you are teaching is \u0026ldquo;convenient\u0026rdquo;.\nEven in very minor doctrinal differences, people will invariably agree with whatever doctrine is being taught by the church closest to their home, the church they were born in, and/or the church that their husband or wife goes to. In other words, whichever church is most convenient. They will change their beliefs to suit the situation, rather than go to the trouble of changing their situation to conform with the truth. No wonder there is so much contradiction in religion!\nA few of the many convenience doctrines that have grown up over the years are teachings about Sunday church meetings, Christmas and Easter celebrations, the infallibility of the Bible, worship of statues, and the secret rapture. None of these have more than a couple of twisted proof texts or warped pieces of logic to support the claim that they represent the will of God. And yet they persist, because they are convenient, and because they are popular.\nSo what does a genuine truth seeker do in the midst of all this? The answer is easy. You seek the truth. You will see bits of it in all religions. But keep seeking more. If you are really lucky, you may come across others who are also genuine truth seekers. But beware! Such people are extremely rare in today\u0026rsquo;s world! As long as you both keep seeking truth, there will be amazing unity in your quest. But even then you must not let the convenience of your fellowship cause you to settle down or give up your search.\nTruth is not an all or nothing thing. You don\u0026rsquo;t have it one day and lose it the next. Neither do you lack it entirely one day and find it perfectly the next. Instead, you either grow closer and closer to perfect truth, or you slip slowly away. In the process of slipping away, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to convince yourself that you\u0026rsquo;re actually finding new truths. But examined more closely, you will see that these \u0026ldquo;new truths\u0026rdquo; will be just \u0026ldquo;convenience doctrines\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;Slipping away\u0026rdquo;, for an individual, comes just as it does for the big organisations. A situation arises where you are faced with an uncomfortable truth about yourself. You either embrace the truth and do what you can to conform with it, or you invent a convenient doctrine which says you are right in your stubborn refusal to change. That doctrine becomes a spiritual noose that strangles any further spiritual growth. Oh, you\u0026rsquo;ll still remember everything that you learned up to that point, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to amaze and confuse lesser people with your apparent spirituality. But your own kinky little convenience doctrine will block you from any further movement toward Perfect Truth. And because Perfect Truth is God himself, and because he is a jealous God, he will not tolerate the false god of your convenient doctrine.\nThe answer for those who wish to find truth is to never stop seeking more truth, and never reject whatever truth you find. The more you do this, the more you will be able to see through the smoke screen of religion, to the perfect truth which lies on the other side. It won\u0026rsquo;t be as easy as it is to find the counterfeits, but it will be infinitely more satisfying.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/eight-ways-to-know-gods-will/","title":"Eight Ways to Know God&#39;s Will","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/quak/8Ways_hu_d3dc7cbeb0dc581d.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/quak\\/8Ways_hu_b670b33c88108389.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/quak/8Ways_hu_da99b210f35732fa.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/quak\\/8Ways_hu_44e610d54af14b0c.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Quaker Similarities","tags":"Practical, Guidance","content":"There is nothing particularly \u0026lsquo;Quakerish\u0026rsquo; about this article, except as it could relate to the concept of silent worship, where Friends believe that God can speak to people.\nIf I told someone that God speaks to me and tells me His will, they would probably think I was crazy. The truth is, though, that God can speak to us, and he will if we\u0026rsquo;re sincere about listening.\nNot much has been written on the topic of how to hear from God. Churches give some clues, but they tend to focus on one area to the exclusion of others. This study is an attempt to share our experience of hearing from God, so that you can put it into practical use yourselves. We list a number of different ways God can speak, so that you can get a more reliable understanding of what God is saying to you. Perhaps you can think of more ways than what we have, or you may word some of the ways listed here slightly differently. That\u0026rsquo;s fine.\nAlso, not all eight ways that we have listed here are equal in value, so we have listed them in order of importance.\n1. Jesus\u0026rsquo; Teachings\nJesus, the Word of God, was God\u0026rsquo;s mouthpiece on earth. When wanting to know God\u0026rsquo;s will, who better to turn to? (John 14:6-7) If Jesus told his followers to do something, then you should seriously consider doing it too, if you want to be one of his followers. If you are considering doing something that goes against what Jesus taught, then you should seriously question it. It\u0026rsquo;s as clear as that. Jesus gives us really good general guidelines to follow. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t always give us instructions for specific circumstances we find ourselves in though, and that is where the rest of the ways to hear from God can be helpful. (See also The Word of God.)\n2. Your Conscience\nThis one is almost as important as the teachings of Jesus. However, a conscience can be \u0026ldquo;trained\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash; for bad as well as for good (1 John 3:20). So we need the teachings of Jesus to train our conscience at times. As you study the teachings of Jesus, you will see that they speak to your conscience. God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit, speaking through your conscience, will tell you that what he is saying is true. You should heed that voice and not sear your conscience by listening to arguments against what Jesus has said. (Romans 1:18-21)\n(See also The True Conscience.)\nThe next five categories are all similar in importance. Problems can result with any of them, if any one is followed to the exclusion of the others.\n3. Advice from Godly People\nWe should listen to the advice of godly people such as those who wrote the Bible or people around us who have proven themselves to be trustworthy spiritual advisors. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to be a \u0026ldquo;loose cannon\u0026rdquo; and want to do things \u0026ldquo;your own way\u0026rdquo;, but by accepting advice from others, you can get a \u0026ldquo;second witness\u0026rdquo; about God\u0026rsquo;s will for you (2 Corinthians 13:1).\nThe weakness with this way of listening to God is that someone you\u0026rsquo;ve trusted in the past could give you advice contrary to the rest of what God is saying. It may go against your conscience or against the teachings of Jesus. St. Paul said that if he or an angel from heaven should say anything contrary to the gospel of Jesus then we should reject it and curse him in preference to rejecting Jesus (Galatians 1:8). (See also Loose Cannons.)\n4. Direct Revelations\nGod can speak to us through dreams, visions and prophecies. We should take the time to listen to what he has to say. Ask God to give you dreams when you go to sleep; and each day when you pray take time to clear your mind of its busy thoughts and allow God to speak to you.\nYou may see a picture, have some words come into your head or have a little daydream which you have not consciously created yourself. In direct revelations God often speaks in \u0026ldquo;parables\u0026rdquo;. In this way, he can get a message through to you that you may have resisted when it came through other means. Once you have the revelation it is important to ask God for an interpretation of the lesson behind it and then to pray for an application of that lesson in something that has been happening in your life. You will need to do so with a willingness to accept the truth of the revelation, no matter how difficult it may be, because often the things God most wants to tell us are things that we are most likely to resist.\nA weakness with direct revelations is that they may just be an expression of our subconscious, or in the case of dreams, they could actually be an attack from the devil (e.g. nightmares). A dream that is from God will provide a solution, and will not cause us to experience irrational fear. God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, and of love and of a sound mind (2 Timothy 1:7).\nA combination of methods 3 and 4, can be quite reliable. If several godly people receive similar revelations in a community listening time, you can feel pretty confident that it is from God. (See also Hearing from God.)\n5. Circumstances\nGod can set up circumstances to assist you in doing the right thing. Open or closed doors can make his will quite obvious. If, for example, you think God wants you to walk on water, but you try it and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, then he probably wasn\u0026rsquo;t the one telling you to walk on water! Easy, eh?\nThe weakness with this approach (if followed exclusively), is that there is a chance that God will want you to persevere under difficult circumstances and the devil will tempt you to give in, just on the grounds that it is too hard. Or the devil could tell you that a golden opportunity to do something that is wrong amounts to a set-up from God when it isn\u0026rsquo;t at all. You can\u0026rsquo;t rely entirely on circumstances, or you will end up just doing whatever is easiest.\nCoincidences\nCoincidences are a bit like circumstances, except that they are a lot more subtle. It has to do with the timing of a circumstance more than the significance of the circumstance itself. For example, if you\u0026rsquo;re considering visiting relatives and you happen onto something in the Bible or elsewhere where it talks about families drawing closer together, you could take it as a confirmation from God that you should go. Under other circumstances the passage in the Bible would not have had the same meaning for you. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to become side-tracked by coincidences though. Some crazy people spend their whole lives looking for God to speak to them through coincidences for every little thing they do. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to create the coincidences. They will happen by themselves when they are from God, and it will be clear when they are.\nDesiresGod can speak to us on an emotional level through his Holy Spirit. This may be expressed in subtle ways, such as an interest in a particular activity. God wants us to enjoy what we do and we will do best what we enjoy doing most. This one is similar to conscience (when we feel a strong conviction to either do something or not to do something), but it is more passive. If, for example, you like working with children, and if there is an opportunity to do so, and if God does not use some other direction to stop you from doing that, you should not feel bad about doing what you like doing.\nThe weakness with this is that the devil tempts us by making sin look enjoyable. Our interest, or motivation, in doing something will not always be pure; we need to recognise when that is so. Following our desires should only be used when it does not contradict other leadings from God.\n8. **Miracles, or \u0026ldquo;Signs\u0026rdquo;\n**God may choose to use a supernatural experience to reveal His will to people. At times people have asked God for a \u0026ldquo;sign\u0026rdquo; to confirm His will for them (e.g. Gideon, in Judges 6:17, 36-40). This is a practice that we have discouraged because it can easily turn into \u0026ldquo;tempting\u0026rdquo; God, and people have been punished for doing that (e.g. Zechariah, in Luke 1:18-20). The only times that God seems to have tolerated people asking for a sign, have been times when he was asking them to do something that goes very strongly against their natural reasoning.\nJesus warned that an evil generation seeks a sign. He said that instead of seeking signs or miracles, we should rely on the words of God\u0026rsquo;s messengers to know God\u0026rsquo;s will (Matthew 12:39). If God has already spoken through other means, then it is wrong to demand that He do a miracle to confirm it. (See also Miracles.)\nWhen trying to hear what God is telling you, think about all eight ways that he could speak to you, and weigh them up against each other. There will not always be unity between all eight ways, but there should be a fairly strong leaning in one direction or the other.\nIt is important that you approach the matter of finding God\u0026rsquo;s will honestly and sincerely, being willing to interpret revelations etc. with an open mind and a willingness to do anything for God, no matter how hard it may be. The purpose of these eight different ways is to use them to get an overall idea of what God is leading you to do and then to act on it. If you do that, you can be sure that God will not fail you. Jesus said that if we ask God for the Holy Spirit, it is like a child asking her father for a fish. He will not give a serpent to the child (Luke 11:11-13). (See also The Reno Principle.)\nIf you consider only one way of hearing from God to the exclusion of others, you can easily delude yourself into thinking God is saying something that he is not.\nOnce you know what God is saying to you, you have a responsibility to follow it. If you ignore what He says to you, then chances are that you will gradually stop hearing from God (because you will destroy your ability to hear him) and you will become dead spiritually (1 Timothy 4:2).\nSo what are you waiting for? Tune in to what God wants to tell you today.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/endtime-prophesy-and-revelation-of-jesus-christ/","title":"Endtime Prophecy and The Revelation of Jesus Christ","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/RevChrist_hu_49653407303d46b4.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/RevChrist_hu_5f88acc9d196f11d.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/RevChrist_hu_ccf71ed5eafdc0d7.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/RevChrist_hu_7a74202c8deb921c.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Endtime and Sex Issues","tags":"Jesus, Prophesy","content":"The prophecies contained in the books of Daniel, Revelation, and the Gospels have many levels, each of which is valid; but only if approached from a sincere desire to know and obey the truth. The Revelation is an integral part of the whole message of God in the Bible, and the key to understanding the book of Revelation is the teachings of Jesus.\nThere are three main ways of interpreting the prophecies in Daniel and the Revelation, and they are all valid to some extent, as long as they are taken in their proper perspective. The first, and least valid, interpretation is that the events prophesied in the Revelation have already been fulfilled. Certainly, the events of 70 A.D. fulfilled Jesus\u0026rsquo; prophecy about the destruction of the temple (Luke 21:6) and about the encirclement of Jerusalem by the Roman armies (Luke 21:20). It is debateable whether there were great signs and earthquakes and distress at the time of the Roman conquest, but if you were a Jew in Jerusalem at the time you could, no doubt, give a convincing argument that this was what Jesus was talking about.\nThen there was the year 1666, with its ominous \u0026lsquo;666\u0026rsquo;. It was the culmination of a time when an entire third of the earth\u0026rsquo;s population perished though the Plague; London was destroyed in a cataclysmic fire; and many Christians from small communitarian sects were burnt and persecuted as heretics by a tyrannical institutional \u0026ldquo;Church\u0026rdquo;.\nAll through the ages there have been religious groups proclaiming the end of the world and the time of the fulfilment of the prophecies. However, the major and crucial point against the argument that the prophecies have all been fulfilled is that Jesus says, \u0026ldquo;And then they shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory\u0026rdquo; (Luke 21:27) near the end of a sermon about the fulfilment of the endtime prophecies. It is emphasised in Matthew\u0026rsquo;s version of the same sermon that this second coming is visible and tangible to all people, (Matthew 24:27, Matthew 24:30) and that it marks the destruction of all who rebel against God.\nThe Revelation says that it is the beginning of the thousand year reign of Christ on earth. (Revelation 11:15, Revelation 19:11-21, Revelation 20:1-4). These events obviously have not happened yet.\nThe second way of interpreting the prophecies is to skip over historic occurrences and view them as symbolic of the battle between good and evil, where love appears to lose, but ends up magnificently triumphant. Every Christian has his or her own Tribulation to go through, (2 Timothy 3:12) and we each experience the coming of Christ in our own life, if we hold onto the truth. The Revelation appears to speak of the judgement that is relevant to people of all times, not just the end times. (Revelation 20:12-13)\nThis is a safe interpretation; but there are too many specifics about times and events for it to be the only valid interpretation. These prophecies consistently predict a worldwide crisis of a magnitude beyond any ever seen in history, and one that will never come again. (Matthew 24:21, Mark 13:19, Daniel 12:1) It is a time which represents the peak of power for the forces of evil; but it ends with the supernatural destruction, or at the very least the imprisonment of, these same forces. (Revelation 6:16-17, Revelation 11:18, Revelation 20:10-15)\nOne basic theme of the Revelation is that the meek, loving \u0026ldquo;Lamb\u0026rdquo; which was slain (Jesus) is victorious over the \u0026ldquo;Dragon\u0026rdquo; (Satan) and the \u0026ldquo;Beast\u0026rdquo;. This not only refers to the spiritual victory of love over hate, but also appears to refer to a future world empire and/or leader (the Beast) that follows and is possessed by Satan.\nThe time for the historical fulfilment of many, if not most, of the prophecies in the Revelation may be in the near future. However, some have already been partially fulfilled, simply because the cornerstone of today\u0026rsquo;s society is the same as that which has existed since the time of ancient Babylon. The forces which are leading to the fullness of the prophecies\u0026rsquo; fulfilment are around right now. It is just that today sees the culmination of many historical developments which have been working together to lead us toward a new world empire. (1 John 2:18)\nThis coming world empire is not an altogether new development. It is simply the culmination of all the human governments of history. In one of the most accurate and verified prophecies ever, Daniel foresees all the world empires from his time until the Kingdom of Heaven comes and destroys the final empire. (Daniel 2:44, Daniel 7:18) Daniel interprets a dream about a statue, predicting the Persian, Greek and Roman empires (Daniel 2). Later on, he sees four beasts, which symbolise in turn the four empires: the Babylonian empire of his day, the Persian Empire, the Greek Empire, and the Roman Empire (Daniel 7). Daniel notes that the fourth beast is, \u0026ldquo;diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; and the main emphasis of the rest of the prophecies in the Revelation, as well as Daniel\u0026rsquo;s, is about this beast: the Roman Empire or, more accurately, a unique empire (represented by the ten toes) which rises from the ruins of the Roman Empire.\nIt appeared that the Roman empire fell a few hundred years after Christ, but it actually divided into \u0026ldquo;East\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;West\u0026rdquo; divisions that remain to this day, and which were actually predicted by Daniel. The two legs of the statue in Daniel\u0026rsquo;s dream fit perfectly with the continuation of the Roman Empire as it co-opted (and almost destroyed) Christianity in two forms: The Byzantine Empire (which was the origin of the Russian and Greek Orthodox churches) and the Holy Roman (Catholic) Empire. The two major world powers today are direct descendants of these two empires. Although the communists have supposedly thrown off their feudal Byzantine heritage, the same spirit of tyranny remains; and although Protestant capitalism supposedly left Catholic feudalism behind, the same hoarding of wealth that was the shame of the Church is even more the definitive characteristic of the Western world. In the same way that the iron and clay in the feet of Daniel\u0026rsquo;s statue would not mix, the present system of man is divided, yet still possesses the strength of the Roman Empire. (Daniel 2:43)\nBut these divisions will be overcome in the final empire to emerge. The fourth beast has ten horns, a characteristic that links this empire to the one spoken of in Revelation 17 (and Revelation 12:3, and Revelation 13:1) which has seven heads and ten horns. An angel explains to John that these heads symbolise seven world empires, of which five are fallen, (Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia and Greece), one is, (Rome) and the other is yet to come. This last one appears to be a future world government which gives rise to a world leader, who will be the most powerful earthly leader there has ever been. He will be totally against God, and he will gain his power directly from Satan. (Revelation 13)\nEven though this final empire only appears to last for a few years right at the end of history, it is the ultimate empire, in that it embodies all of the worst (and perhaps the best as well) in all of the empires of human history. It certainly is the most significant one in prophecy.\nRevelation 17 goes on to say that this beast (i.e. the last world empire) is red (Revelation 17:3) and that a prostitute called Babylon the Great sits on it. An angel tells John that the prostitute is a great city that reigns over the kings of the earth (Revelation 17:18). Another angel goes on to explain that the main feature of this city is its wealth and importance as a place for trade (Revelation 18).\nAn interpretation that fits well with modern day events is that the beast is Russia (red = communist) and the whore is the U.S.A. Like a prostitute America talks of love (represented by institutional Christianity), but it really only wants money. Today, the U.S. has political and economic dominance over the entire world; but according to prophecy, the beast (The Soviet Union) will one day \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.\u0026rdquo; (Revelation 17:16) Then the Soviet Union, working in union with other nations, which will give it power to rule the world, will go on to become the fulfilment of the rest of the endtime prophecies about the final, terrible Beast.\nMany of the things mentioned in the Revelation were simply impossible until less than a hundred years ago. Who could have considered even 200 years ago that it would be possible for men to destroy the earth (Revelation 13:18), but today we have grown accustomed to the threat of annihilation hanging over our heads, through the threat of nuclear war. John hears about an army of 200 million people (Revelation 9:16). This has only really become possible since post-Mao China. Nuclear strikes now make passages of destruction by fire sound more plausible. (Revelation 8:7-11, Revelation 16:8, Revelation 18:8-10) With 90% of the scientists that have ever lived being alive today, ours is certainly an age of many people running to and fro, and knowledge being increased. This is another sign of the end, according to Daniel 12:4. Only with today\u0026rsquo;s worldwide telecommunications, has it been possible for this prophecy to be fulfilled: \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;The people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies\u0026rdquo; (referring to the two witnesses). (Revelation 11:9).\nThere are some other interesting things occurring right now that could be signs that the time is coming closer. The number 666 (Revelation 13:16-18) appears as a fundamental code built into the Universal Product Classification System (known as the \u0026ldquo;bar-code\u0026rdquo;). This is a development of technology that is amenable to some sort of universal person classification system, and a cashless society based on a mark (perhaps some form of bar-code) without which one cannot buy or sell. The star which falls to earth and makes the waters \u0026ldquo;bitter\u0026rdquo; so that many men die is called Wormwood, which is translated as Chernobyl in Ukrainian. Radiation poisoning of water fits this prophecy perfectly, although the level of death which actually occurred (at least so far) is nowhere near the level prophesied. (Revelation 8:10-11)\nThese occurrences are not total fulfilments of the prophecies, but their similarities are perhaps indications of what is to come. A pattern is certainly coming together, and as the time comes closer, the fullness of the prophecies will be revealed more and more. The statistics of population growth, energy consumption, non-renewable resource consumption, species extinction, desert expansion, arms production, environmental destruction and pollution show an exponential growth towards inevitable disaster. In fact, the longer there is no worldwide crisis to \u0026ldquo;fix\u0026rdquo; the problem, like widespread famine, war, or plague to cause death to a large proportion of the world\u0026rsquo;s population, the greater the crisis will be when it comes. It is impossible to physically maintain the present exponential growth of both greed in the developed world, and population in the developing world.\nOf course, there are more than enough resources for double the present population\u0026rsquo;s needs, but the scenario presented here assumes that the world systems will not change their basic attitudes, and it is a reasonable hypothesis in the light of history. It is even more reasonable if we observe that there was only one government system that was ever even slightly in line with God. That was the ancient Jews; yet their claim to being God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom was lost with their rejection of the higher revelation of God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom through Jesus Christ. (Galatians 2:16, Galatians 2:28-29)\nActually, there is much in prophecy to suggest that the Antichrist will, at least initially, claim to be the Messiah, coming to usher in the Millennium of peace, with his government posing as the visible kingdom of heaven: bringing peace and prosperity (Daniel 8:23-25), and deceiving people into believing that he is the Christ. (Revelation 13:11, Matthew 7:15, Matthew 24:24)\nOne of the most widespread themes of the increasingly popular and mainstream New Age movement is that disaster (Great Tribulation) can be averted if enough people change their consciousness to align with an emerging thought pattern, which arose in the 60\u0026rsquo;s. This new pattern, at first, appeared to be more in tune with the practical applications of the teachings of Jesus. It included such emphases as simple living, a caring attitude, sharing, being against the system, and a lack of the hypocrisy so prevalent in the churches. However, as we go into the 90\u0026rsquo;s, the New Age movement is becoming increasingly materialistic and increasingly aligned with the system, and with such an alignment, it is quickly gaining momentum and respectability . Indeed, because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t even claim to be Christian, its potential excesses are far beyond that of the church; and its emphases on hedonism, the occult and spiritism leave the door wide open to acceptance of Satan himself as the new Messiah. Its philosophy is a perfect vehicle for the Antichrist, through which he can claim to fulfil the misplaced hopes of a lukewarm population who want, at any cost, to avoid suffering. Perhaps Daniel hints at this when he says, \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;by peace he shall destroy many\u0026rdquo; (Daniel 8:25).\nThe doctrine of avoiding suffering is contrary to the message of Christianity. Indeed, it is a fairy tale. Yet this doctrine is almost universal; not only with the New Age movement, but also with Pre-Tribulation Rapture theorists.\nOne thing in the prophecies is sure: everyone will suffer. The fundamental question is whether we shall suffer for obeying God, or for disobeying God. If we choose to break ourselves on the Rock of the teaching of Jesus, we pay now, and we suffer persecution for our decision; but even in this life we will have spiritual comfort and deep satisfaction from being true to our conscience; and in the future we will have infinite eternal reward. God promises to correct us, often painfully, as an expression of His love. (Revelation 3:19, Hebrews 12:4-11) If we choose to avoid suffering in the short term, we will pay much more later, and there will be no reward. In this case the best we can hope for is a speedy annihilation; and we will probably suffer the unbearably torturous wrath of God, with total despair and hopelessness. It ends with us being crushed to dust by the Rock. (Luke 20:18, Revelation 14:9-11, and Revelation 16)\nThe doctrine of suffering and enduring is central to Christianity. Not only did Jesus provide the ultimate example of dying for love and God, but we are clearly taught to do the same. There is a fire that is coming; for the unbelieving it is a fire of destruction (Matthew 13:49-50, Revelation 16:8); for the obedient it is a fire of purification. (Mark 9:49) To the Christians who endure to the end, in obedience to God, and who \u0026ldquo;overcome\u0026rdquo;, belong rewards that include eternal life, salvation, sitting on the throne with Jesus, being God\u0026rsquo;s children, and other things that are hard to understand at present, probably because the dimension of heaven is quite different from what we are used to on earth. (Revelation 2:26, Revelation 3:5, 12, 21)\nThe Revelation talks of a time of great persecution of Christians by the Antichrist. (Revelation 12:13, 17) At this time it will seem that the Antichrist has totally destroyed the Christians. (Daniel 7:21, Daniel 7:25; Revelation 13:7) Many who were thought to be true Christian leaders will lose their faith (Daniel 11:35), but this is only so that Christians will be truly tested, to see if their ultimate faith was in God (Revelation 13:10) or whether it was in their religious leaders. The testing will also be to see if we will truly obey, endure and overcome, no matter what. It is hard to say for sure exactly how difficult these times will be. It seems that God will leave it up to our free will whether or not we shall disobey Him. The Bible says that he will not give us testings beyond which we can endure. (1 Corinthians 10:13) However what we think is \u0026ldquo;unendurable\u0026rdquo; is not always what God thinks we are capable of enduring.\nA central passage of The Revelation talks about a universal marking system without which, \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;no man might buy or sell\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; (Revelation 13:17) Those who accept this mark \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and \u0026hellip; be tormented with fire and brimstone\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; (Revelation 14:10). God\u0026rsquo;s people are described as those who \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; (Revelation 15:2). The number of the beast is 666 (Revelation 13:18), and this number is an important clue to understanding the way which God uses to separate His children from the devil\u0026rsquo;s.\nThere is only one other place in the Bible where the number 666 appears; it is the number of talents of gold that Solomon received in a year (1 Kings 10:14) . The connection between the two verses is that they are both referring to a means of exchange, or money, the love of which is the root of all evil. (1 Timothy 6:10)\nMoney is a subject that Jesus continually spoke about. It is the basis of all the empires of man, and the antithesis of faith in God. (Matthew 6:24) We are urged to not worry about any of our material needs (Matthew 6:25-31) and to seek above all what God wants (Matthew 6:33). This is the solution to the puzzle of the book of Revelation, for it is by living by faith in God that we come out of Babylon (Revelation 18:4) and it is by living by faith in God that we are able to refuse the mark of the Beast. Most people will not believe they can live without the mark, just as today most people do not believe they can live without money. If we live without owning possessions (Luke 12:33, Luke 14:33) and if we trust in God for our food and clothes (in accordance with Christ\u0026rsquo;s teaching) it will be a lot easier to obey the command to instantly run away, not even stopping to gather anything up, in the day when the \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;Son of man is revealed.\u0026rdquo; (Luke 17:31-36)\nThe book of Revelation talks of the true church (the woman) fleeing to a prepared place in the wilderness for the time of the Tribulation (Revelation 12:6) by means of the wings of an eagle (Revelation 12:14). Jesus mentions cryptically in Luke\u0026rsquo;s passage about fleeing, that, \u0026ldquo;Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.\u0026rdquo; (Luke 17:37) This seems to be a reference to the true church being taken to the wilderness and protected (at least to some extent). Perhaps the eagles are some form of air transport that will bring scattered Christians together, away from the system. Time will tell.\nThe concepts of not working for money, working for love, and trusting God all work together to form a theme that not only solves the puzzle of the Revelation, but that is a recurring theme throughout the whole Bible. The wilderness faith of the Christians in the Tribulation is paralleled by the experience of the Jews in the Exodus from the Egyptian Empire (Exodus 12 onwards) where they were fed manna which fell from heaven for 40 years. In the very beginning of the Bible was the curse that God put upon disobedient Adam and Eve; most of the curse involved having to work in the dust for food (agriculture) instead of eating freely from the Tree of Life. But Jesus has set us free from the curse of working for food! (Galatians 3:13) He even commands us not to do so. (John 6:27)\nAfter the events of the Tribulation, the faithful people who did good works (Matthew 25:31-46, Revelation 20:12-13) receive the Tree of Life back again, with the curse totally lifted. (Revelation 22:2-3)\nThe book of Revelation is part of the overall message of the Bible, and it has great relevance to how we should live our lives right now, as well as having relevance in the times of the end. Even if the time of the fulfilment of the prophecies was not about to come, it would still be relevant, because the book is really \u0026ldquo;The Revelation of Jesus Christ\u0026rdquo;, and it is specifically for those who obey Jesus Christ. (Revelation 1:1, and Revelation 22:6) As John says, \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;the time is at hand\u0026rdquo; (Revelation 1:3). There is teaching in this book which we are urged to keep. (Revelation 1:3, and Revelation 22:7) Obedience to the teachings of Jesus is a major key to understanding this book\u0026hellip; especially, but not exclusively, in the end times. It seems that the rewards are for all of God\u0026rsquo;s people throughout history. The price is all that we have (Luke 14:33) but the reward is more than we can possibly imagine.

(Matthew 17:14-21)\nThe situation in this story from Matthew 17 is that some of the disciples saw a boy who was devil possessed, and they tried to cast the devil(s) out of him. They were not able to do so. Jesus became frustrated with them, and said that their problem was that they lacked faith. He went on to say that if they had faith, they could order a mountain to move from where it was, and jump into the ocean! And he concluded by saying that the kind of faith that he was looking for would not come without prayer and fasting.\nIn this article we will consider flaws in the traditional understanding of fasting as well as in the traditional understanding of faith.\nThe traditional approach to fasting is one of total abstinence for a short period of time, followed by a much longer period of time during which we do not fast at all. All or nothing. Black or white. But I\u0026rsquo;m not so sure that this is a correct understanding of what fasting represents.\nIn comparing himself with John the Baptist, Jesus noted that most people saw John as a faster and Jesus as a feaster. And yet when his disciples were unable to drive the evil spirit out of this boy, Jesus told them that the real problem was lack of faith, caused by a lack of prayer and fasting.\nFrom this statement, it appears that Jesus must have fasted himself. It is reasonable to assume that he would not have been reprimanding them for having failed to do something that he had failed to do himself.\nIt is likely that Jesus did some traditional fasting, i.e. totally missing meals on occasions. But remember that he also taught us to fast secretly. He had so little privacy that it would have been almost impossible for him to miss whole meals without people knowing it. So it is even more likely that his fasting took the form of going through the motions of eating a meal, while at the same time eating less than what his flesh would have liked to eat.\nIn other words, he would have \u0026lsquo;fasted\u0026rsquo; in a way that would have gone unnoticed by those around him\u0026hellip; just by eating small amounts, or by passing up something that was particularly tempting, in favour of something that was less tasty. And I think that he would have learned to listen to God with regard to how much to eat at every single meal.\nThe importance of this kind of fasting is that it teaches us personal accountability on a moment to moment basis. Paul told the Thessalonians to \u0026lsquo;pray without ceasing\u0026rsquo;. (1 Thessalonians 5:17) Because there appears to be a link between prayer and fasting, perhaps we need to be fasting without ceasing as well.\nIn Luke 2:37 we read about an 84-year-old widow who fasted and prayed \u0026lsquo;continually\u0026rsquo;. She too, must have practised a kind of fasting that did not require her to skip food altogether. Paul seemed to be advocating this same approach when he wrote to the Corinthians: \u0026lsquo;Whether you eat or drink,\u0026rsquo; he said, \u0026lsquo;or whatever you do, do it all to the glory of God.\u0026rsquo; (1 Corinthians 10:31)\nThis idea of fasting without ceasing (like the concept of praying without ceasing) takes us away from the religious all-or-nothing approach to our relationship with God. It requires us to be instantly obedient in the smallest details of our lives, and constantly in touch with God. This is in contrast to seeing our relationship with him as being something that we got over and done with in a single ritual act at some time in the past.\nThis approach should not be taken to mean that the person who eats the least is the most spiritual. On the contrary, it could lead some people to be more liberal with regard to what they eat. Their \u0026lsquo;fasting\u0026rsquo; could even require them to eat some things that they were previously afraid to eat. Anorexics, for example, would learn to eat more, and bulemics would learn to eat less. Fasting without ceasing does not need to imply total self-denial. What it really implies is just total obedience.\nAsking God for direction with regard to everything that we eat could help us to develop greater thankfulness for every bite of food that God gives us. We really could \u0026rsquo;eat and drink to the glory of God\u0026rsquo; with this approach, as well as being open to his instructions when he wants us to stop.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s relate this approach to fasting to the problem the disciples were having with being unable to cast the devil out of the boy. Jesus chided them for their \u0026lsquo;unbelief\u0026rsquo;. Our natural response to that would be to think that they should have bluffed more, shouting louder at the devils and \u0026lsquo;claiming\u0026rsquo; a victory even if the evidence seemed to indicate a failure.\nThis is the traditional Pentecostal approach to such things. But it is based more on a lack of faith than any true expression of the kind of faith that Jesus was looking for. The faith he was looking for was only to be found through moment to moment contact with God. Jesus was saying that you do not cast out devils on the basis of your theology, or on the basis of some other doctrinal statement.\nThe disciples had, in this situation, arrived at the right conclusion, i.e. that they should cast the devil out of the boy. But they had not arrived at it on the basis of personal direction from God, and so they lacked the supernatural power to actually do what they believed was the right thing to do. They had decided to attack the devil on the basis of purely human reasoning: The kid was possessed; he wanted to be delivered; and his relatives had come asking for help. So immediately they leapt into action, in an effort to live up to the expectations of the people.\nBut there is only one way to do anything that is supernatural, whether it is throwing mountains into the ocean or kicking devils out of people, and that is to do it because God tells you to do it. Of course, if you are not in a moment to moment relationship with God, then you will not know what to do. You will be bluffing\u0026hellip; and hoping that he will back you up if you happen to fluke on what it is that he would have told you to do if you had taken the time to ask and listen.\nBecause of our traditional misunderstanding of faith, we assume that \u0026lsquo;great\u0026rsquo; faith would be able to do spectacular miracles. And because none of us can do spectacular miracles, we each secretly feel like failures. We become intimidated by the bluffers and the counterfeiters, and we become tempted to imitate their lying signs and wonders. But that is not the answer. The flaw in this approach is that it views faith in terms of our selves and the miracle, rather than focusing on ourselves and God.\nMiracles are the result of faith, and faith has to do with God, not miracles. Jesus was saying that when we have faith in God, we can do anything that he tells us to do. If he tells us to fly or to cast out devils or to order mountains to be tossed into the sea, then it will be no more daunting than if he tells us to stoop down and pick up a piece of paper. Whatever he tells us to do, he will enable us to do. The decision is his, and the wherewithal to carry it through is his responsibility.\nWhen we have developed this intimate relationship with Christ in the little things (like eating and drinking), and when we have learned to be faithful about doing such things \u0026lsquo;without ceasing\u0026rsquo;, then all of the supposedly big things that come along at his direction will take care of themselves. They won\u0026rsquo;t seem to be big when they are just as routine as deciding whether to have another helping of mashed potatoes. The obedient servant will only be doing his or her duty, and the miracle will simply have to happen, because they came as a result of the Master\u0026rsquo;s decision, and not as a result of our own wishful thinking or human reasoning.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/forsaking-all/","title":"Forsaking All","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/ForsakingAll_hu_c3381ac1a4b1e0eb.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/ForsakingAll_hu_1b706d242926561f.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/ForsakingAll_hu_d0a21c4a0bad0e51.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/ForsakingAll_hu_d37c02e0ea7a9f67.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Top Forty","tags":"The Teachings of Jesus, Living By Faith","content":"When Jesus walked by the shores of Galilee, he called some fishermen who had just caught the biggest haul of their lives: \u0026ldquo;Come follow me and I will make you fishers of men!\u0026rdquo; Immediately they forsook all and followed him! (Luke 5:2-11) They forsook the fish, the nets, their boat, their livelihood, their old life, and even their poor old father!\nHow could they do such a thing? How could they forsake their living, and their own family and friends, without even giving notice, to follow this strange Stranger and his motley crew? They did it because he offered them a better life, a better job, with a better Boss, for a better family, and with better rewards! Why \u0026ldquo;labour for the food that perishes\u0026rdquo; (John 6:27) when you can win immortal souls, who will be your friends forever!\nSomeone said, \u0026ldquo;First let me say farewell to my father.\u0026rdquo; Jesus replied, \u0026ldquo;He that puts his hand to the plough and then looks back is not worthy of me!\u0026rdquo; (Luke 9:61-62) \u0026ldquo;But let me at least bury my father,\u0026rdquo; said another. (The father probably wasn\u0026rsquo;t even dead yet, and this might have taken months or years!) Jesus firmly said, \u0026ldquo;Let the dead bury the dead! You come and follow me!\u0026rdquo; (Luke 9:59-60)\nGod refuses to take second place to anything or anyone. He will not let you put any other god before him - not your old job or your old boss or even your old family and friends! God is your Boss now and he has a new job for you that will not wait. This is God\u0026rsquo;s first test for every would-be disciple. To see if you love him enough to put him first by forsaking all immediately to follow him!\n\u0026ldquo;Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you!\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 6:33)\nGod will not tolerate you putting anything else before him and his work. If you can bring the boss and family with you, fine. But obviously the disciples\u0026rsquo; father was unwilling to leave his boat business and all those nice fish and follow Jesus with them\u0026ndash;and we never hear of him again. The father who stuck by the business vanished into oblivion, while his sons wandered off with a perfect Stranger and made history, helping millions of souls for eternity.\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t it ridiculous now to compare the business, the father, and the family, which all soon perished, with the millions of immortal souls who have been saved through the decision of those fishermen to put God first that day, drop everything, and follow Jesus! Now that we can see the results, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to know they made the right choice despite their father\u0026rsquo;s objections and the wrecking of his business.\nNothing is more important than God and his work of love to save the world. God\u0026rsquo;s only time is now! The guys who stalled never came back. And their list is longer than the list of followers. Many are called, but few have chosen to follow him above all. Who and what are you going to put first?\nWhy not ask the boss and family to come along? They could follow just as well, you know.\nIf they\u0026rsquo;re not willing, they don\u0026rsquo;t deserve you! Which is more important: Serving them or saving the world? The time is Now! Tomorrow is too late.\nThe Lord makes the entrance exams hard so we\u0026rsquo;ll know right away if you\u0026rsquo;ve got what it takes.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s kind of like being born: It\u0026rsquo;s a crisis experience that the mother and baby go through. If they can make that they can usually make the rest pretty well. From then on you just go step by step and grade by grade and it becomes a little more spread out, like the growth of a baby.\nLukewarm believers make God sick to his stomach. (Revelation 3:16) He says the double-minded are \u0026ldquo;like the troubled sea when it cannot rest.\u0026rdquo; (Isaiah 57:20) I cannot comprehend people\u0026rsquo;s hesitation in serving the Lord all the way! If he\u0026rsquo;s worth serving at all, he\u0026rsquo;s worth serving full time and with all that you have!\nHow about you? Are you ready to give up everything, in absolute loyalty, and full-time service to Jesus? Do you want to be part of the last great spiritual revolution? If so, it requires 100% dedication. Do or die!

We forsake our parents merely by living together communally, seven days a week. Young people who suddenly decide to join a community like our own (after having lived with their parents) \u0026ldquo;forsake\u0026rdquo; the relationship that they had at home as a natural consequence of choosing to move in with us. This is not terribly different from what happens when a young person leaves home to get married, move into a flat on their own, move into student accommodation at a university, or travel or work abroad.\nWhen you join our community, you become part of a fellowship which may well take you overseas, as well as taking you out of your present accommodation and away from your present employer. That is just the practical reality of living in a community such as our own. So we don\u0026rsquo;t have to come right out and say much about forsaking your family for God. Forsaking your parents is a natural part of the more positive decision you have made to live with us.\nBut sometimes there is discussion about how your decision will affect (or has affected) your relationship with your family. This is particularly true if your parents register objections to you making a decision to live with us. We have always discussed this informally in the past, and we have done so in the context of each individual\u0026rsquo;s particular circumstances. However, this study is being prepared to help future potential members to cope with objections from their parents.\nUsing Tact\nSometimes problems can be resolved merely by tactfully addressing the concerns that your parents have expressed. We stress the word \u0026ldquo;tactful\u0026rdquo; because, in your enthusiasm to put your own faith into practice, it is easy to think that you should set out to convert your parents as well. We should warn you, however, that so far we have never had a member of our community succeed in actually converting either of their parents to join us. We have had a fair few succeed in getting their parents to come and visit us and even to stay with us for weeks and (in one case) months at a time. But none of those successes came overnight; they came after years of membership in our community.\nIt seems that the first reaction by most parents is to view your decision with suspicion. This suspicion is directed toward the group that you have chosen to join. It takes time before they can fully accept your decision. So if you are going to try to discuss our community with your parents at all, you will need to use a lot of tact.\nIf you do or say things that could raise fear or suspicion in the mind of your parents, you can be almost certain that the fear will spread, and that it will set back any further efforts to win their support for your decision. Unfortunately, saying too little can frighten them almost as quickly as saying too much. However, we generally feel that young people err on the side of trying to say too much to their parents. Either way, you should pray humbly for wisdom in what you say or do not say.\nWe will now look at some of the things that most often concern parents when their children choose to join a new religious movement like our own. They are: (a) concerns that you may be coaxed into sexual immorality, (b) concerns that you are going to be ripped off financially, (c) concerns that you are going to be encouraged to break the law, (d) concerns about you dropping out of school or quitting your job, and (e) concerns that you may be taken someplace where they cannot gain access to you.\nSexual Immorality\nThe concern about sexual immorality is probably (in our case) the easiest to refute, because of our extremely high standards with regard to sex. Nevertheless, our enemies do everything they can to suggest that we are the Children of God, a group that is notorious for its liberal sexual teachings. These false accusations are complicated by the fact that the founder of our community was a member of the Children of God for a few months in 1975, before learning about their sexual perversions. It was precisely because of Children of God teachings about sex that he chose to leave that group.\nApart from our almost puritanical sexual emphasis, however, we do have a fair bit in common with the Children of God in other areas of Christian doctrine. We also distribute heavily illustrated literature, like they used to do. Enemies are able to draw on those similarities and then to slip over into talk about Children of God teachings with regard to sex, implying that we teach the same things.\nBecause it is so difficult to sift through all of the issues, and because the simple truth is that we are definitely not the Children of God, it is probably best not to bring up the subject of the Children of God unless your parents raise it. But if you get a chance to share with regard to our teachings about sex (especially if your parents hint at concerns in that area), you should try to do so.\nBear in mind, however, that even very conservative teachings about sex can still trigger alarm bells. The subject is so controversial precisely because people feel so strongly about it, and because what one person feels comfortable with, another does not.\nThe most \u0026ldquo;bizarre\u0026rdquo; things about us with regard to sex are that we openly condone masturbation (something which is covertly if not overtly condemned by most evangelical churches); and we encourage celibacy in preference to marriage. In either case, it helps if you can emphasise the fact that our position is not really bizarre at all.\nIt is almost certain that your own parents and religious leaders practise masturbation at times (or at least that they did when they were single), so it would be hypocritical of them to condemn us for admitting to something that they have done and continue to do secretly. If you read what we have written about masturbation, you will see that the very reason that we encourage it is because it acts as a safety valve on sexual energy which could easily result in genuine sexual immorality if not given some legitimate outlet like masturbation.\nWith regard to celibacy, our position is halfway between the Protestant and Catholic extremes, making us more balanced than either of the other two. Catholics \u0026ldquo;forbid\u0026rdquo; marriage for the clergy, and Protestants almost \u0026ldquo;require\u0026rdquo; it. We simply discourage it.\nThis policy of playing down the sensational aspect of our beliefs and trying to compare them with the beliefs of more \u0026ldquo;respectable\u0026rdquo; organisations can be helpful whenever your parents become fearful about our teachings. This is true even of the fact that we live together in a community. Try to get your parents away from comparing us with hippy communes (with their usual emphasis on drugs and free sex) and toward comparing us with other Christian communities in both Protestant and Catholic traditions.\nFinancial Rip-offs\nOn the other extreme to the sexual immorality concern is the concern about you being financially ripped off. We cannot categorically deny this one, because it is a requirement for membership in our community that you forsake all private ownership. We teach it because Jesus taught it (Luke 14:33), and we teach it because we have found from deep personal experience that the love of money really is the root of all evil. (1 Timothy 6:10)\nEach of us has been through the same process of forsaking everything that we own ourselves. We have found that by forsaking all private ownership, it has freed us from an attachment to our possessions that we had not even been aware of before we did it. By communally sharing ownership, there is greater unity and trust between members.\nWhen people join us, they have the option of giving their possessions to some other charity. (We recommend World Vision because they have a strong interdenominational Christian emphasis, and because they primarily help people in the Third World, where needs are most genuine.) But new members may also give their possessions to us; and that is the preferred option. The Bible says, \u0026ldquo;Where your treasure is, is where your heart will be.\u0026rdquo; (Luke 12:34) If your heart is with us and with what we are doing, then it makes sense to do like the early Christians did; they laid the proceeds of the sale of their possessions at the feet of the apostles, to be distributed amongst all members of the community according to their needs. (Acts 4:34-35)\nWe do not allow people to hand over all of their wealth until after they have lived with us for at least a week; but if they do make such a decision after that initial trial period, it is an irreversible one. If you change your mind one day later, your money and possessions will not be returned to you. We do not hide this, and the reason we do not hide it is because we do not want to rip you off. We want you to think and pray seriously about such a decision before you make it. If such a decision could be turned on and off at will, there would be no place where we could draw an absolute line. Someone could forsake $100 when they first joined the community, and then demand that it be refunded to them when they leave a year later, even though it had long since been spent by the community for community needs and projects. It is not fair to have one policy with regard to people who have a lot of wealth to forsake, and a different one for those who have only a little. You will never gain the spiritual benefits that come from truly forsaking everything, unless you understand that it is an irreversible decision. And letting you know this ahead of time will help you to think more seriously before you make such a decision.\nIt is precisely because of our honesty on this matter that we have had so few people join us. And most of those who have joined us have had very little material wealth apart from the clothes on their backs anyway. There have, however, been a few who forsook thousands of dollars. We are pleased to be able to state that, so far, not one of them has complained later about their decision.\nNevertheless, this is another area where you may not get enough time to go into all of what we have just said here, if your parents object on the grounds that you may be ripped off financially. And even if they did hear what we have to say, there is no guarantee that they would believe it. Once again, our honest opinion is that the best approach is to say very little to your parents about this topic unless they are the ones to bring it up. We will try to explain why this is our advice:\nTo begin with, we want you to be able to spend a trial week with us. You do not need to make a final decision about your wealth until after you have spent that week with us. But you won\u0026rsquo;t get that chance if your parents panic and take steps to stop you from spending time with us. If, after a week with us, you want to discuss such a decision with your parents, then that is probably the more appropriate time to do so. Most of the people who spend a trial week with us do not even see the week out. They find our lifestyle (or some other aspect of what we teach or do) not to their liking. In other words, it isn\u0026rsquo;t like you are being thrown into a meat blender that is going to rob you of your freedom to not join us at the end of the week. If it happens that you decide against joining us, there has been nothing lost with regard to your wealth. However, if your parents become overly frightened before you come for your trial week, they may try to stop you from visiting altogether, and we do not want that to happen; so we advise against bringing up the subject of forsaking all with them, at least until you are actually ready to make such a decision. (Note: We are talking about adults here and not minors. Minors have to have formal permission from their parents to stay with us.)\nIf you do decide to join our community after the trial week, then you need to determine which belongings are actually yours, and which belong to your parents. Some parents take the attitude that everything they buy for their children still belongs to the parents, and you do not have a right to sell, give away, or in any other way dispose of their \u0026ldquo;gift\u0026rdquo; without their permission. If that is the case, then you may need to formally hand these possessions over to your parents for them to dispose of as they choose. We will not let you bring possessions into the community which have strings attached, e.g. that you are not to give it to anyone else in the community.\nHowever, there will be other things that are undeniably your own. These are things about which, under normal circumstances, your parents would not interfere with your decisions. If you decided to spend, sell or dispose of these things, they would more or less consider it to be your own business. With regard to things that are your own property, we see little need for you to discuss such a decision with your parents, unless you have doubts about whether it is the right thing to do. Common sense would tell you that they would advise against giving your wealth to a community that they are not a part of. We accept this as a fact of life, and do not try to hide it from you. It is almost certain that your parents will object to you forsaking all of your wealth to us or to anyone else.\nFor the average person in the system, life is all about accumulating as much wealth as you can. To them, if you spend wealth, then it should be with the intention of getting something of equal or greater material value in return. Imagine telling your parents that you are going to give all of your wealth to anyone. Unless you have a guarantee that you can get it back, or unless you are getting something of material value back, they would almost certainly object. Consequently, there seems to be little point in discussing such a decision with your parents.\nAt the end of this article (under the sub-heading Adolescence) we will discuss the general reason for us encouraging some young people not to discuss some of these controversial issues with their parents.\nIf the subject does come up, it may help if you understand that our community is different from most communities which require people to forsake all of their wealth. None of our members work for money; and we do not collect the dole. We all live by faith. We would probably use at least some of your wealth to cover day to day living expenses. However, when it is gone, we all trust God together for further provision. Because of this, we are less likely to accumulate massive wealth. In a community where members continue to work for money, and where they put all of their income into a common purse, millions of dollars can accumulate in a very short period of time. Where there is great wealth, there is also great temptation for abuse. We can appreciate this.\nOf course, our poverty also becomes a cause for concern amongst some parents. Nevertheless, the fact that we all enjoy much the same level of wealth or poverty, and the fact that all members have equal voting power with regard to how money is to be spent, means that there is minimal opportunity for corruption to creep in.\nBreaking the Law\nActually, this is a fairly minor concern. But it could be that your parents will become genuinely concerned about the possibility that you are getting involved with a group that is into doing something illegal (e.g. using or selling drugs). This is another area which is fairly easy to address, providing your parents can be specific and frank about their concerns. It is easy to reassure them that we are not into drugs, for example. Hopefully because we will be honest about some things that we know they will not like, they may take our word for it when we specifically deny other things.\nOften what they are saying when they express vague fears about such things as whether or not we will encourage you to break the law, is just that they fear the loss of control that they will experience over you leaving them and living with someone they do not know. (See Loss of Control below.) Parents have similar fears when their children go off to live with other young people, whether at a university or in a flat. They don\u0026rsquo;t want you to be subject to bad influences. Because there are more of us than you would normally be living with in a flat, and because we are more of a mystery to them than a uni, which obviously is very visible and permanent, the fears will be increased with regard to ourselves. If you feel that is the case, then do everything you can to encourage them to meet the members of the community that you will be staying with. Encourage them to read up on what we teach\u0026hellip; even if this results in them discovering other things to worry about, such as the fact that we teach people to \u0026ldquo;forsake all\u0026rdquo; (see above). At least in reading what we have to say, they gain exposure to some good things about us as well, and if they do become frightened, their fears are less likely to be vague and irrational.\nThere are times when we have broken minor laws, like laws against people distributing literature. We have often done this as part of a formal protest, and some of us have been arrested at times. Very few parents feel good about their kids being arrested; however, because of the nature of our actions, the penalties have always (so far) been minimal, and we are frequently let off altogether, because of our otherwise good behaviour and because of the seriousness of the points we have been trying to make in our demonstrations. Most parents are aware that university students often become involved in protests and demonstration. Arrests as a result of those actions are often accepted by parents (and by the rest of society) as trivial, if not noble.\nDropping Out of School or Quitting a Job\nParents are always concerned if their children decide to quit a job or drop out of school. \u0026ldquo;Success\u0026rdquo; for most parents means getting a formal education and then using it to get a job, and then staying in that job until you get a promotion, or until a better job becomes available. But reality is that young people regularly leave jobs or drop out of school without serious damage to them or to their quality of life. They do so for many different reasons, and such decisions probably have as many good consequences as they have bad consequences.\nObviously it is good to have a formal education. Degrees can open many doors for you in later life, and they are useful for more things than just making money. But they also take a long time and a lot of dedication before you can receive them. If it was just a matter of dropping by the uni and picking up a handful of degrees, then we would be very much in favour of it. However, each new degree involves several more years of your life; and there comes a point at which you must decide between studying now with the hope of using your degree at some time in the future, and just getting on with what it is that you wish to do.\nThese days it is much easier for young people to take time off from studies and then return to them later. If you are becoming overly stressed by your studies, a break now could be a good way to renew your enthusiasm for the course that you have undertaken. After some time away from a particular course, you may also decide that you are more interested in a different academic discipline. It is far better to make such a career change now, while you are young, than to persevere with a course of study that your parents pushed you into, only to find out in later life that you really do not have the aptitude for what your parents wanted you to do.\nSimilar arguments could be put forward with regard to jobs as well. There are benefits to be obtained by remaining faithful in a single job. However, most successful people in the business world have had to change jobs at times, in order to better themselves.\nThey have to learn how to take risks. And in your case, the risk you are taking is that you believe you will be happier working for God than working for money. It is not such a great risk when you think about it. If you decide that what we are offering is not what you want, you can probably find employment once again. Our experience has been that people who spend time in our community actually develop skills that have made them even more successful when they have returned to the work force.\nOur advice with regard to parental concerns about you quitting your job or dropping out of school, is that you should emphasise to your parents the fact that they are not irreversible decisions. Where possible, we have tried to encourage people to just take time off in order to visit us for a trial week, so that you will not have burned your bridges behind you if you decide at the end of the week that our lifestyle is not for you.\nLosing Control\nNow we come to something that is probably fundamental in all of the concerns that parents have about their young people joining our community (or any other similar community). The concern is that your parents are going to lose control over you. Because concern over loss of control is so universal, it is also the charge most universally levelled against any group which threatens that control. We are the ones who are accused of mind control, on the grounds that we have supposedly caused you to think in a way that is \u0026ldquo;uncharacteristic\u0026rdquo; as far as your parents are concerned. Most of them do not even realise how much they are seeing themselves in us, i.e. how much they are obsessed with control.\nOne of the best ways to reassure your parents that they are not going to lose touch with you is rather obvious\u0026hellip; stay in touch with them. Where possible, let them know where they can contact you (even if it\u0026rsquo;s just through email addresses, postal addresses, or phone numbers). But make sure that you also do what you can to call, write, or visit them, even after you have joined the community. Because some parents (and even some members of the general public) can become violently opposed to us, we try not to give out our home addresses too quickly. Unfortunately, many parents cannot understand this, because they are used to churches and other large institutions having public addresses (although the private addresses of people in these institutions are not usually given out freely either). You will need to do everything in your power to play down the absence of a private address, and as we just said, the best way to do it is for you to take the initiative in communicating with them. If you do not keep the communication lines open, they will begin to become nervous, and it is much more difficult to convince them that they have nothing to fear after they have started to feel suspicious. Prevention is much easier than a cure.\nIn its most extreme form, this fear (about losing control) will result in your parents imagining that you are going to be spirited away to some foreign country where you will totally disappear, and never be heard from again. The saddest thing about this fear, is that it causes parents to behave in such a way as to maximise the chances that their fear will become a reality. Any group which has more than one location will be inclined to move a new member to a different location if the place where he or she is staying is subjected to attacks or harassment. (Ask the organisers of any women\u0026rsquo;s shelter or youth refuge if this is not true.)\nIf distraught parents continue to attack and harass the community (e.g. by constantly calling or visiting, being abusive, going to the police, to the media, to government bodies, and by seeking assistance to have you kidnapped by deprogrammers), even phone calls and mail contact may have to be curtailed. This is particularly true if they use the information they get from such contact with you to make further attacks on the community. If your parents begin to behave in this way, it is important for YOU to communicate to them how they are creating the very problem they claim to be worried about happening. If your leaders try to warn them, the warnings will probably be taken as threats.\nAdolescence\nJesus taught his followers to \u0026ldquo;hate\u0026rdquo; their parents for him. (Luke 14:26) At first glance this appears to be either a contradiction or an error in the translation; for the greatest commandment, according to Jesus, was that we should love God with all our heart, and love our neighbour as we love ourselves. In another place, Jesus specifically refers to people pretending to use commitment to God as an excuse for depriving their parents of respect that is due to them. However, the thought expressed in this passage from Luke 14 is also repeated elsewhere. So it is not likely to be an error in the translation.\nWe have never made a big deal of Luke 14:26; but we have noticed that, when young people try to obey Luke 14:33 (about forsaking their material possessions), they often run into stiff opposition from their parents, and parents invariably use a sort of emotional blackmail, where they plead with their child, \u0026ldquo;If you love me, please don\u0026rsquo;t do this.\u0026rdquo; And if they refuse to give in to their parents, the stakes are raised, and the child is accused of hating his/her parents, and we are accused of teaching them to hate their parents. So Jesus must have been preparing his disciples for what the parents themselves would say in opposition to his teachings.\nWe have noticed that the problem is not limited to young people who forsake all and join a Christian commune. Although parental opposition is most fierce when someone joins a Christian community, there is often stress between parents and children when the children are going through adolescence; and for many people, this tension continues throughout life.\nParents often do not want to let their children grow up. They find it hard to trust them to make mistakes and suffer the consequences themselves. They are particularly offended if their young people support ideologies which they themselves do not support. And so they lash out at the \u0026ldquo;evil influences\u0026rdquo; that are apparently seeking to undermine their authority.\nIn many cases, the adolescent is able to get support from the larger community. Society now recognises the rights of teenagers to move away from home and to engage in activities that their parents disapprove of. Teachers and counsellors actively encourage young people to question things that they always took for granted when they were living at home. And parents who object to such interference are generally regarded as authoritarian and/or overly possessive.\nBut when it comes to what we are teaching, there is almost universal disagreement with ourselves. School counsellors, the general public, police, the media and the courts all find themselves suddenly sympathising with the over-protective parents. Suddenly it is understandable that a \u0026ldquo;distraught mother\u0026rdquo; would seek to have her grown son kidnapped and deprogrammed. It becomes reasonable to falsely charge a son or daughter with a crime, as a way to get him/her away from us and into police custody; and the police will often knowingly conspire with such a plot. Everyone will secretly conspire to use terms like \u0026ldquo;mind control\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;cult\u0026rdquo; without anyone bothering to ask what the terms mean, or to determine what evidence there is for using the labels. The important thing, to them, is to stop someone (you) from obeying the teachings of Jesus.\nFor you as a young person, this opposition can be daunting to say the least. The whole world is out there telling you that you are an ungrateful son or daughter, who owes it to your parents to drop this talk about obeying Jesus (\u0026ldquo;at least temporarily\u0026rdquo;) and fulfil your duty to your parents. They will call you a rebel and a runaway, and use whatever means they can think of to generate feelings of guilt for your thoughts about obeying Jesus and living by faith.\nHowever, unless you are prepared to live your life as an appendage of your parents, you will need to cut the emotional umbilical cord that your father or mother is using in an attempt to control you and to rob you of your right to grow up and function as an adult. Instructions from Jesus to stop calling anyone \u0026ldquo;father\u0026rdquo; seem to go along with this injunction to \u0026ldquo;hate\u0026rdquo; your mother and father for his sake.\nUsually it is a temporary separation; and when your parents have adjusted to recognising your rights, the relationship will improve dramatically. But the responsibility still lies with you, the adolescent (though you may be 30 or 40 years old) to take the initiative. If you wait for your parents to lead the way in giving you the freedom to disagree with them, it cannot be said that you have thought for yourself when you did so. It has to come from you personally, and it takes courage to do so.\nYour peers will do so for selfish and rebellious reasons; but Jesus calls on you to take a stand against your parents for a good reason. If you do it in faith, you will be able to continue to love them and treat them with respect, without giving in to their efforts to control and manipulate you. It is a difficult and traumatic time for all adolescents, but it is a rite of passage through to adulthood, and it is one that God himself has called on you to go through.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/freedom-prayer-and-besetting-sins/","title":"Freedom, Prayer, and Besetting Sins","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/FiliPrayer_hu_c6e89ae13c5ca3d2.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"630\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/FiliPrayer_hu_7e770c7d997f7245.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/FiliPrayer_hu_fdc015031f7b473c.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/FiliPrayer_hu_220cddae0218be80.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Strong Meat","tags":"Practical, Prayer","content":"I have a few different thoughts I would like to share with people, each one probably worthy of a short article on its own. However, until or unless I get some spare time to do them as separate articles, I will just kind of mix them all in together in this letter, since there is a common theme between them. The theme is just an expression of concern about where people are heading spiritually, particularly in light of individual bases now being autonomous to one another.\nMy concern is that we may be going down the path that we have noticed all religious denominations going down, where they gradually become more and more lukewarm, insincere, and out of touch with God. So my first point has to do with the concept of autonomy in itself, and where it is leading.\nSome people seem to have pretty much the same idea of autonomy that Annette had, which was that it was a promise by Dave that he would not make anyone accountable, and that people could pretty much do whatever they like. When a day came that Annette had to be accountable for things that she was doing (or not doing), she accused me of reneging on my promise not to make her accountable! But, of course, she had missed the point right from the start.\nAutonomy, like life itself, is not just an end in itself; it is a TEST. What are you going to do with the freedom that God gives you. As we have learned in our Bible studies, some people use their liberty \u0026ldquo;as an occasion to the flesh\u0026rdquo;. And I have seen this happening in virtually all of the bases. To counter this, we could say, \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s scrap the autonomy thing, and go back to the old ways, with lots of reports and lots of checking up on people.\u0026rdquo; But I don\u0026rsquo;t think that would solve the problem. We recognised this very real possibility (i.e. that autonomy would be abused), and it was almost because of this weakness in the character of some individuals that we started the autonomy experiment in the first place. The idea is to give you enough rope to hang yourselves. Annette did it well and truly, and others are doing it as well. Whether or not you ever get kicked out by your local base, if you abuse your freedom, you are going to be hung spiritually when you stand before God. And for those who want to really grow spiritually, we are going to have to consider the possibility that we will need to start a whole new revolution if the rot sets in too much more deeply. In some ways, that whole new revolution has been going on in our lives for quite some time, anyway. That is because the real movement of the spirit is not the Jesus Christians organisation. The real movement of the Spirit is the relationship that we each have personally with God.\nSo now to my second point, and that has to do with prayer (and to a lesser degree, with fasting). I\u0026rsquo;m at a loss for words here, because the truth has already been said several times before in other articles I have written, and yet people continue to ignore the overwhelming importance of these truths.\nYour relationship with God is only as good as your prayer life; and your prayer life is more than good intentions and past religious experiences. It is even more than ritual disciplines (although I think that for many of you, even ritual disciplines in the area of prayer are getting to be pretty rare).\nWe have this ethical dilemma with regard to prayer, where we teach that it should be secret (and the same with fasting). So there is no mechanism for leaders to \u0026ldquo;check up\u0026rdquo; on people, to find out if they have been praying. And yet it is incredibly easy to know whether a person is praying or fasting without ever poking your nose inside their prayer closet. Apart from insincere ritual prayer/fasting, which only makes a person religiously proud, real prayer and fasting will keep you in the spirit. If people are taking grievances against you because you are out of the spirit, then obviously you are not praying and you are not fasting. Easy, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nAnd the number of second and third stage grievances being taken within the community over the past few months seems to indicate that the MAJORITY of members in our community are not praying and fasting much at all. This definitely is one area of our spiritual life where good intentions don\u0026rsquo;t count for anything. We can talk ABOUT prayer and ABOUT fasting, and have good intentions to change, but if we don\u0026rsquo;t actually DO IT, (and keep on doing it), we are going nowhere spiritually.\nWhen that couple joined us in Vihiga, one of the first things she pushed for was a \u0026ldquo;day of fasting\u0026rdquo; each week. We refused and said that fasting should be private and secret. When she could not get an audience for a fast, she lost interest in fasting altogether (and probably prayer too), and it was only a couple of weeks before they both backslid. It was very easy for us to see that they were not praying and fasting. But, you know, it is pretty easy to see that others of us are not praying and fasting either. And unless we do, we are headed for destruction spiritually (whether or not we manage to stay on as members of the JCs or to get a lot of lit out).\nAnd now I come to my third point, which is \u0026ldquo;besetting sins\u0026rdquo;. It seems that each one of us has some area of our life where we keep falling short over and over again. These are what we call \u0026ldquo;besetting sins\u0026rdquo;. They are usually the topic of most grievances taken against us. We have people in the community who are habitually impatient (like me), grumpy, dishonest, lazy, proud, selfish, gossipy, etc. Hopefully by now you at least each KNOW what your besetting sin is. (Some may have more than one.) But one of the things that keeps us from making progress with our besetting sins is that we trivialise them. We tell ourselves (and others too, at times) that they are not really all that bad, that they are just foibles or weaknesses, that God made us this way, and sometimes even that they are almost virtues (like I often do when I am too harsh in correcting someone). We convince ourselves that at least we are humble, because we know that we have these problems; but then we don\u0026rsquo;t bother to seriously declare war on the sin itself. It\u0026rsquo;s easier to convince ourselves that we are better off holding onto it, because it keeps us humble. (And if the truth were known, we\u0026rsquo;re probably not as humble as we would like to think we are either!)\nAll of this is just an extension of the common churchy perversion of the grace of God, where they more or less say, \u0026ldquo;Let us sin, so that grace may abound.\u0026rdquo;\nI want to relate this concept of besetting sins to my two earlier points: prayer and fasting, and the freedom that goes with autonomy. We are each (whether members of the Jesus Christians or not) free to give in to sin, or to take action to stop sinning. Actions to stop sinning are, of course, much harder than just giving in to them, especially considering that none of us is perfect. So no matter how hard we try to overcome selfishness, for example, there are still going to be times when we slip up, whereas giving in to sin yields no report cards at all. However, continuing to fight the good fight of faith is what discipleship is all about. (\u0026hellip; contrary to the false grace teaching that says just saying \u0026ldquo;Lord, Lord, you have done it all and I don\u0026rsquo;t need to do anything!\u0026rdquo; is what it is all about!)\nSo what is your besetting sin? Please, take time to answer that right now. Write it down if you have to, so that you don\u0026rsquo;t let this article go to waste by just fizzling out with good intentions. And while you are at it, how much time did you spend in praying in the last week? Write that down too\u0026hellip; not for anyone else to read, but for you to look at and think about. And how many meals have you fasted in the last week. Once again, just secret information between you and God.\nYou see, the fact that such stuff is personal becomes a good excuse for even hiding it from ourselves. So we just carrry on from day to day, quite indifferent to whether or not we are getting anywhere spiritually.\nI know that there are such concepts as praying without ceasing, and fasting without ceasing, which deal with our attitudes more than the objectively measurable stuff. And I know that our failures CAN turn into victories, by making us humble if nothing else. I also know that real change is not going to come through the law, but through changes that can only originate from deep inside of ourselves. But all of that will never happen if we choose to run away from the uncomfortable truths about how little we are actually doing at the moment to change.\nYou have some answers now to the questions I asked (and hopefully at least SOME of us will have some answers that we are not totally ashamed of). The next step is to decide whether or not you need to make some serious changes in your life, especially in your prayer life. I think that if we can start making those changes, we will see things picking up in everything else that we do. You are free NOT to make those changes, but at least have the courage to admit that you have made such a choice, by examining your answers and making a decision to improve your prayer life or not to improve it.\nThink about it. But more importantly, pray about it\u0026hellip; and I mean REALLY pray about it.\nLove, Dave\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/god-has-no-grandchildren/","title":"God Has No Grandchildren","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/lefto/GrandK_hu_9c7bc75b624d8b77.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/lefto\\/GrandK_hu_5fd4bc0de379aa4a.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/lefto/GrandK_hu_401ca99ae6a3aeee.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/lefto\\/GrandK_hu_f14e37d6d16498ec.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Leftovers","tags":"Theology","content":"We do not have to be perfect to be accepted by God. But we do need to be original.\nWhat God is looking for are people who will do their best to follow him. He is not looking for followers of his followers, but rather for people who will personally respond to his voice in their own conscience.\nMost people choose to follow great people rather than follow God. And when we do this, we lose contact with the only real source of truth. The world is full of Wesleyans, Lutherans, Franciscans, Gandhians, Calvinists, in fact, followers of everyone except God. It is not enough to follow Billy Graham, St. Paul, or St. Mary. Unless we graduate from hiding behind human leaders to escape personal accountability, the human race is damned.\nWhen not hiding behind past heroes, we often hide behind parents, pastors, and police, not daring to differ with any of these human authorities either; and that is why history is filled with atrocities and injustices.\nScience teaches that we should use the learning of others merely as a launching pad from which to make new discoveries ourselves. And past \u0026ldquo;truths\u0026rsquo; should not be regarded as unchangeable if new evidence suggests otherwise.\nNot everyone is capable of making dramatic improvements, but everyone should be trying to find more truth.\nMany of the official \u0026ldquo;saints\u0026rdquo; in the church were opposed by the church hierarchy of their day. Of course it does not mean that everyone opposed by the establishment is necessarily right.\n\u0026ldquo;It takes more than persecution to make you a Galileo; you must also be right.\u0026rdquo; But being right will almost always lead to persecution. God seems to engineer it that way\u0026hellip; probably as a way of testing sincerity.\nWe cannot rely on the faith of our parents or that of other spiritual forefathers. God has no grandchildren. Each of us must come to him personally.\nIt would anger most of the great heroes of faith if they were to see how their lives have been used to stop people from progressing spiritually. Gandhi, for example, talked of his whole life as being an experiment with truth. He urged people to ignore things he had said previously when new experience led him to change his conclusions. Enough time has elapsed since his death that we should be able to see a great many more errors in his observations, and yet many continue to blindly worship him. The same could be said of the way people respond to other leaders as well.\nBut what of our own commitment to following Jesus? Jesus is the one great exception. He is the only mediator between God and people. He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. He is perfect. He is God.\nMany have claimed to have an improvement on what Jesus taught, but so far we have not found one that even comes close to equalling what he taught. As we follow God in our conscience, we find ourselves drawn closer to all that Jesus said and did as well.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/the-kingdom-of-god/","title":"God&#39;s Kingdom","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/KingHeaven_hu_5b41756a972ee3d3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"251\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/KingHeaven_hu_9ba78fc9d7e739f7.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/KingHeaven_hu_6788f80cace96f3a.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/KingHeaven_hu_d74f09b3abfe03ba.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Endtime and Sex Issues","tags":"The Kingdom of Heaven","content":"There is one phrase which seems to sum up the very essence of the link between the Gospels and The Revelation, and that is the phrase I have used as the title for this article.\nSadly, there is a feeling amongst many professing Christians that what is contained in The Revelation is just mysterious and confusing symbolisms about topics that are too difficult to understand and not at all important to everyday Christians. Yet, when you observe just how much the term \u0026ldquo;kingdom of God\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;kingdom of heaven\u0026rdquo; is used in the gospels, and how much that summarises what is taught in The Revelation, it becomes apparent that The Revelation is vital to the life of every practicing Christian, especially at this point in human history.\nIn the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer, Jesus calls on his followers to pray over and over again, each time we come before God, that his kingdom may come. This attitude is fundamental to our relationship with God. In the teachings and parables of Jesus, you find one phrase coming up over and over: \u0026ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is likened unto\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; and he goes on from there to give clue after clue about what this great kingdom should mean to all those who wish to be his followers. Growth in our understanding of this mysterious kingdom is also obviously essential to our Christian walk.\nI have previously pointed out that the full name of the final book of the Bible is \u0026ldquo;The Revelation of Jesus Christ.\u0026rdquo; But \u0026ldquo;Jesus Christ\u0026rdquo; is more than just a name. When you study Bible prophecy, you find that it says a lot about kings and kingdoms, and one of the observations we have made is that kings and the kingdoms over which they rule are often used interchangeably. A \u0026ldquo;horn\u0026rdquo; on a \u0026ldquo;beast\u0026rdquo;, for example, may be referred to as a \u0026ldquo;king\u0026rdquo;, but it may also be referred to as a \u0026ldquo;kingdom\u0026rdquo;. And so, the \u0026ldquo;revelation of Jesus Christ\u0026rdquo; may be a revelation which makes us appreciate more who Jesus Christ is, but it may also be the ultimate revelation which Jesus Christ brings, that is, a revelation of his kingdom. And the greatest paradox is that these are not two different things, but they are one and the same. Let me try to explain.\nThis mysterious thing Jesus called \u0026ldquo;the kingdom of heaven\u0026rdquo; is not a kingdom that comes with observation; it is not \u0026ldquo;of this world\u0026rdquo;; it is not ruled by carnal weapons; in fact, by human political standards, it is not a kingdom at all. Instead, it is a relationship between the human race and our Creator. It consists of attitudes and spiritual forces at work in the lives of those who are humble, loving, and sincere in their faith toward God. All of these forces come from the Spirit of the One who Created us, which, in some mysterious way, is also the Spirit of the One who died on the cross in Israel some 2,000 years ago. In other words, God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom IS the Spirit of Jesus. The kingdom of heaven is the REVELATION of Jesus. The kingdom of heaven is what Jesus came to demonstrate, at the same time that it is something yet to come when he returns.\nThis on-going relationship and revelation between the Creator and His Creation is why The Revelation is, to me, so important in gaining a fuller understanding of all that Jesus said and did in the Gospels. The work is still going on, and it is leading to a fuller revelation of God\u0026rsquo;s will than the human race has yet experienced.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Seventy Weeks\u0026rdquo; prophecy in the book of Daniel is a significant part of that progressive revelation of God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom, as it shows that \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rsquo;s people\u0026rdquo; evolved from the physical descendants of Israel (Jacob), to those individuals everywhere who have a humble, teachable spirit toward God, to a final coming together of all those sincere individuals in the final seven years of earth\u0026rsquo;s history just before Jesus returns. This amazing picture of God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom transcends all of our efforts to bring about world peace through manmade religions, human governments and even through human protests against those governments.\nThere is a real kingdom coming, but it is so far above and beyond anything that human efforts have ever been able to achieve, that we will need a powerful spiritual transformation before we will be able to even begin to comprehend it. As Jesus said to Nicodemus, \u0026ldquo;Unless a person is born again, they cannot even see the kingdom of heaven.\u0026rdquo; This transformation is the highest calling of every living soul on this planet.\nThat kingdom is \u0026ldquo;at hand\u0026rdquo;. It is closer now (of course!) than it has ever been before, and so we need to be \u0026ldquo;born again\u0026rdquo; now more than ever before, to be ready for it.\nForget about religious organisations. Forget about formal ordinations and theological training. Forget about various political ideologies and agendas. Forget about everything except your relationship with the Lord of the Universe and the coming kingdom to which he alone holds the keys. Prepare ye the way for that great Day of the Lord! That is the call of God to each of us today. And to respond to that call, we need to open our hearts and minds to the truths of The Revelation\u0026hellip; the events that are most significant in these \u0026ldquo;last days\u0026rdquo;, such as the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, the institution of a worldwide \u0026ldquo;mark\u0026rdquo; in the right hand or the forehead, without which people will not be able to buy or sell, and the rise of a world leader who will appear to be bringing world peace. All of these events point to something far greater that will come AFTER them according to The Revelation. The genuine preceded the counterfeits, but it\u0026rsquo;s ultimate fulfillment will come after God has used the deceptions of the Antichrist to sift the hearts of all mankind.\nGod\u0026rsquo;s kingdom is coming, Friends. God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom is coming! We need to be prepared, in heart and mind and soul. Religious counterfeits are nearing their ultimate end, and political substitutes are approaching their diabolical consummation. We are about to head into the times of greatest trouble ever to come upon the earth. Deception is going to be widespread and devilishly clever. Only a broken heart before God will protect any of us from becoming a part of that great deception. We each need to fall on our faces before God and cry out for his protection and covering\u0026hellip; that we might be totally yielded to his will and open to his kingdom, which will reign only in the hearts of those who are prepared to give up all and become like little children before him.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/headcoverings/","title":"Head Coverings","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/pamu/Headcoverings_hu_f77a06012bd282c0.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/pamu\\/Headcoverings_hu_182042e9a01d4c58.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/pamu/Headcoverings_hu_b40af595845fe49.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/pamu\\/Headcoverings_hu_ebcb211df93fd7c2.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Leadership","tags":"Religion, Theology","content":"There have been whole denominations that have split over varying interpretations of one chapter of the Bible, which is: 1 Corinthians 11. This is the chapter that deals with women covering their heads when they pray.\nEven the Catholics, who are not usually given to literal obedience to things that Paul teaches, have been drawn into this one. It is the reason that so many nuns wear elaborate headgear (called wimples when they cover the neck and chin). Little lace hankies are also worn on the heads of many Catholic women when attending mass.\nProtestants, too, have laboured over just how far to take this chapter. Some have ignored it altogether while others require women to wear scarves almost constantly. (After all, the Bible does say, in 1 Thessalonians 5:17, to pray without ceasing, and so if they are going to cover their heads when praying, then they would need to cover their heads without ceasing too, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t they!)\nIt is strange that American fundamentalists, who insist that every word in the Bible is of equal importance, have recently been so vocal in condemning Muslims for doing exactly what their own theologians have told them that this chapter is teaching Christian women to do, which is to keep their heads covered.\nOf course, anyone who has read much of what we teach would probably guess by now that we are not going to teach what has been traditionally taught, even though it seems (on the basis of the various interpretations so far available) like the traditionalists are the ones acting most in accord with what the chapter is literally saying.\nHowever, in our own approach to 1 Corinthians 11, we had a number of clues that something was being overlooked. One clue was just all of the divisions that have resulted over the passage. They couldn\u0026rsquo;t all be right, and it was just as hard to believe that only one of them was right. Another clue that something was being overlooked was the apparent ability of many religious people to supposedly get it right on this one issue and yet be so far off on everything else that the Bible says.\nBut a third clue is simply the fact this is the only passage in the whole Bible that teaches the head covering doctrine. Jesus never mentioned it. Peter never mentioned it. And to my knowledge, Moses never mentioned it. The Bible says, \u0026ldquo;Let every word be established in the mouth of two or three witnesses.\u0026rdquo; This principle is a good guide when it comes to any confusing or disputed doctrine. If it is built on only one passage of scripture, it is obviously not something of major importance. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that it is necessarily false, but only that it should not be regarded as a fundamental truth.\nSo with that approach, we decided to have a closer look at the passage that was causing all of the trouble. And the key to understanding it correctly jumped out at us in the very first verse on the subject (verse 3). Here it is: \u0026ldquo;I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.\u0026rdquo;\nRemember that we are talking about \u0026ldquo;head coverings\u0026rdquo;. Look for the word \u0026ldquo;head\u0026rdquo; in the passage above, and you are well on your way to understanding what the entire passage is really all about. You will also notice that the various interpretations have fairly consistently left out reference to the heads mentioned in this passage.\nThe next two verses (verses 4 \u0026amp; 5) say: \u0026ldquo;Every man who has his head covered while praying or prophesying, disgraces his head. But every woman who has her head uncovered while praying or prophesying, disgraces her head; for she is one and the same with her whose head is shaved.\u0026rdquo;\nThe confusion comes from the final few words, about a woman with a bald head. Paul is referring to a \u0026ldquo;tradition\u0026rdquo; that exists throughout much of the world, of women having long hair and men having short hair. He acknowledges that it seems like \u0026ldquo;nature\u0026rdquo; has made this tradition almost universal, in verses 14-16, but he also clearly says that we as Christians have \u0026ldquo;no such tradition\u0026rdquo;. So obviously, he is only using this tradition (or \u0026rsquo;natural\u0026rsquo; tendency) as an illustration of something spiritual. He knows that people can identify with the idea of a woman being humiliated by having all of her hair shaved off her head. A bald woman, he is saying, is a bit of an oddity\u0026hellip; something to gawk and laugh at. And he is saying that a Christian woman should be just as embarrassed to have her \u0026ldquo;head uncovered\u0026rdquo; when she is praying.\nBut remember that the \u0026ldquo;head\u0026rdquo; he is talking about being uncovered when she prays is her husband (or some other male leader if she is single). (NOTE: Even the idea of \u0026ldquo;male\u0026rdquo; vs \u0026ldquo;female\u0026rdquo; is, in our opinion, talking about a deeper spiritual truth and not just which kind of sex organs a person has; but we will not get into that in this article. We will write as though it is just talking about literal males and females, at least to begin with.)\nSo how should it be disgraceful for a woman to uncover her relationship with her \u0026ldquo;head\u0026rdquo; when praying or prophesying? Remember that in spiritual matters she is supposed to be acting in obedience to God or Jesus. She may have some kind of a submissive relationship with her husband in other areas of her life. (And even the most liberated married women need to have SOME kind of rules for co-operation with their husbands if their marriages are going to work.) But when it comes to spiritual matters the husband-wife relationship kind of goes into the background (or under a covering). It should not be lifted up and exposed as evidence of her spirituality. Male-female submission is just an attempt to organise a system of co-operation.\nSadly, the churches that teach most strongly about women covering their heads are often the ones most obsessed with actually FLAUNTING the headship of their husbands. So a piece of cloth on their heads does nothing to achieve what Paul was really talking about. In other words, the head covering teaching as Paul taught it should be more about FREEING women from obsessive teachings about submission to a human authority, and yet it has been turned into a teaching about making human submission even more oppressive and more visible.\nI believe that what is being dealt with in this passage is really an important teaching about a paradox that exists in the real world, which can relate to far more than husbands and wives. I will try to explain.\nWe often find ourselves in situations where we must submit to or co-operate with other people. This submission is important in learning patience and humility. Even extremely liberated groups like the unprogrammed Quakers, with whom I fellowship, still have submission teachings of one sort or another. We are taught to seek out and respect the wisdom of the \u0026ldquo;meeting\u0026rdquo; in spiritual matters. We have clerks and elders. There is not total anarchy, and at times the authority that is exercised can be quite startling. All of this is good and necessary, and I fully support it.\nBut over and over again, throughout history, people have made the mistake of thinking that the human authority (i.e. \u0026rsquo;the man\u0026rsquo; in Paul\u0026rsquo;s way of reasoning) is the beginning and end of God\u0026rsquo;s voice here on earth. And so the human authority is flaunted as the way to spirituality. When that becomes an end in itself, error almost always results.\nPaul says that it is okay for \u0026rsquo;the man\u0026rsquo; to uncover his head (Indeed, it is a shame if he does not), but only insomuch as his \u0026ldquo;head\u0026rdquo; is Christ. Far too often, all that we see being promoted (as the source of spiritual authority) by the many religious organisations that exist in the world today are other human beings. The particular religious system ends up being offered as the answer to the needs of the world in preference to what should actually be offered, i.e. the (professed) head of that system, which is Christ\u0026hellip; or better still, God, who is the real head of Christ.\nSo the message of 1 Corinthians 11 is that we need to cover up our various systems of authority (in which various humans submit to various other humans) and promote submission to God as the ultimate answer to the world\u0026rsquo;s problems. The political realities of organisations are not bad in themselves; rather they are quite necessary. But they are the means and not the end. If we leave God out of it, our spirituality turns into little more than political debate.\nAlthough I believe strongly in the need for us to be in submission to one another, it is good common sense for each of us to minimise emphasis on that aspect of our Christian walk when trying to communicate what it is that we really stand for. In our relationship with God (prayer) and in our spiritual declaration to the world (prophesying), we should \u0026ldquo;cover\u0026rdquo; (or hide) the organisation and our various roles in it. The general public and the media often become obsessed with wanting to know who is in charge, what are the rules, where we meet, when our organisation started, etc. Such information is not secret, but it does miss the real point of our existence. We are not here to promote an individual or an organisation. We are here to build the invisible kingdom of God.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s keep our human heads covered and lift up our almighty omniscient eternal Head for the world to see.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/hearing-what-we-dont-want-to-hear/","title":"Hearing What We Don&#39;t Want to Hear","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/Hearing_hu_7ebd341984a75239.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"630\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/Hearing_hu_b6094e9cc111fc71.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/Hearing_hu_12058db1c2dffc.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/Hearing_hu_e59173e9bbd11ea7.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Top Forty","tags":"Hard Truth","content":"What I want to say here is so basic that it\u0026rsquo;s almost a first requirement for faith. And yet it seems to be so rare (and so hard to communicate) that it hardly exists in the world today.\nWhat I want to talk about could be called Hearing from God (but then we already have an article with that title), Sincerity (We have heaps of articles on that topic.), Humility (Same there.), or Faith (ditto).\nThe problem appears to be that people can talk about all of these things in theoretical terms (as we have) and yet never really come to grips with their own inability to hear God say something that they don\u0026rsquo;t already want to hear. And when that happens, then it becomes doubtful whether they have a real relationship with God at all. Sincerity, humility, faith\u0026hellip; they all pretty much go out the window if your \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; is not able to tell you something that you don\u0026rsquo;t want to hear.\nBecause God has given us free will, he will not force us to hear something we don\u0026rsquo;t want to hear. So the initiative lies entirely with us personally. If we continue to close our hearts and minds to correction in areas where our will is stubborn, then our will becomes our god, and the real all-powerful God who created the universe, is left tied up in a corner as a result.\nThis is how the churches have come to believe that they are following Jesus, even though they can be shown objectively they don\u0026rsquo;t even know what the Jesus of the Bible told his followers to do. The explanation for this extreme hypocrisy is just that they do not let the Jesus of the Bible tell them anything that they do not already want to hear (and that is pretty much everything that he said), at the same time that they imagine or pretend to be hearing things from God that have actually come from their own will. Their will and the will of God are seen as being pretty much one and the same. If, through circumstances, they are forced to change their thinking on something, then they will say that God has shown them that they were wrong. But they will not willingly open themselves up to being told that they are wrong apart from that.\nUnfortunately, I see the same thing happening in our own midst. In my more depressed moments I begin to wonder if we have learned anything at all from our observations with regard to the closed minds of the religious establishment. Just because we can show where they have closed minds does not mean that we do not also have closed minds.\nFor myself, I have found that it is necessary for me to kind of psyche myself up before I can really honestly and humbly hear from God. I have to remind myself over and over of just how stupid and selfish I am and just how all-knowing and loving God is, before I ask him to talk to me.\nI have to remind myself that some of the best things God had to say to me in the past were things that every fibre of my being seemed to fight against when I first heard them. Invariably I react in fear when he finally does speak. (See \u0026ldquo;Fear Not!\u0026rdquo;) I feel myself being threatened and humbled by the things that God is really saying, on those few rare occasions when I open myself up to truly listen to him.\nObviously, if God is smarter than us, then he is going to want to tell us things that we don\u0026rsquo;t already know. And probably the things that he would most want to tell us are the things that we are least open to hearing. It\u0026rsquo;s true that, at times, the things he says will confirm things that we already felt were true. But the hardest things for him to teach us are always going to be those things which go against our prejudices, and against our selfish instincts. There must be volumes of things that he would like to tell us, but which we have never been able to hear, simply because we would not \u0026ldquo;allow\u0026rdquo; him to say them.\nUnless we are willing to lay all of our prejudices on the altar before we ask him to speak, he is going to be gagged, and we are only going to be able to discern his will (at best) through the frosted glass of our own selfish, stubborn, proud, lazy will.\nI cannot stress strongly enough just how important and basic this lesson is. It\u0026rsquo;s a one-point sermon, but it\u0026rsquo;s a point that will either block or unblock whole worlds of revelation, depending on whether or not we take it to heart. How open are you to hearing God say that you are wrong, that you have been, like Saul of Tarsus, kicking against the very things that he would like to reveal to you?\nSome of the greatest revelations that I have ever received have come at times when I managed to work up the courage to almost challenge God to tell me something that I had been fighting against. \u0026ldquo;Go ahead and show me where I am wrong!\u0026rdquo; I would declare. \u0026ldquo;Test me! And I promise to do everything in my power to accept whatever you say, no matter how much it hurts.\u0026rdquo; And then he has spoken. And I have discovered just how hard it is to accept what he says.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s the kind of challenge that God wants to hear. He wants to hear you agree to humble yourself before your worst enemy, sacrifice your only son, cut off your hand or pluck out your eye, forsake everything that you have, or do whatever else he may ask you to do, as long as he tells you to do it. And if you want his wisdom (instead of your own foolish imitations), then laying yourself open to God in this way is what you will need to do\u0026hellip; again and again.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/hope/","title":"Hope","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/Hope_hu_35396efe17a6ea18.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"630\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/Hope_hu_9905d9d8dff0deff.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/Hope_hu_764b0a8355f0a3c9.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/Hope_hu_1014c8c26e7dab68.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Inspirational","tags":"Inspirational, Positive, Hope","content":"I went to a church meeting yesterday, and the Bible reading was the Old Testament promise that God would not allow one of his righteous servants so much as to stub his toe against a stone. If he fell, the passage promised that God would send an angel to catch him. The congregation did not appear to see any contradiction (or even a connection) in the fact that the reading was preceded by an announcement that the pastor was not there because he had fallen off the back of his ute, and broken his wrist pretty badly. Apart from the obvious humour of that situation, there was the oft ignored contradiction that some of the things we read in the Bible do not seem to measure up to our everyday experiences.\nAs it happened, I had also attended another church service earlier in the day, where there was also a reading about Hope. It included this quote: \u0026ldquo;Hope has one foot planted in the world as it is, and another planted in the world as it should be.\u0026rdquo; I liked that. It seems to sum up well the importance of hope in a world where things do not always work out the way we think they should.\nThis seems to be something that so many religious extremes miss. It has always baffled me that so much is said about faith and about love, yet in that great \u0026ldquo;Love Chapter\u0026rdquo; from Corinthians (I Corinthians 13), Paul says, \u0026ldquo;And now abides faith, hope, and love.\u0026rdquo; Hope kind of gets left out, and is sometimes even looked down on, on the assumption that it represents a lack of faith.\nIf someone says (to the average evangelical), \u0026ldquo;I hope that I will be accepted into heaven when I die,\u0026rdquo; the evangelical would most likely take it as proof that the person saying it is bound for hell, simply because they have not expressed \u0026ldquo;I know for sure\u0026rdquo; faith on this all-important matter. For many of these sort of people, it is not even good enough to say, \u0026ldquo;I BELIEVE I am going to be saved.\u0026rdquo; You have to KNOW it, and to know it beyond even the slightest hint of doubt.\nWhat this fosters is something I have, in the past, called \u0026ldquo;salvation by bluff\u0026rdquo;. Each person tries to out-do the other with their boastful expressions of faith that everything has been taken care of; they have their ticket to heaven; and nothing in all of creation could ever take that ticket away from them. Personally, I don\u0026rsquo;t think God is impressed with the self-deception that such a teaching and attitude fosters.\nThis same bluster pours out of the mouths of many with regard to other matters that may not be as certain as they want us to believe as well. They want you to know that they have the answers for all sorts of things and that they can prove it, in one way or another… usually through some convenient biblical proof text.\nBut when I turn to the Bible, I see that the idea of justice and peace is described in terms (e.g. lions lying down with lambs, and no righteous person falling without an angel to cushion the fall) that rarely measure up to my own day to day experience.\nI rarely see miracles; I often ask for things that I don\u0026rsquo;t get; and all of my best efforts to be righteous keep falling flat. All of this tends to be air-brushed out of what the keenest believers profess. For those looking on, such dishonesty often acts as grounds for dismissing faith in God altogether. But only, in my opinion, because both sides have overlooked hope.\nIn particular, hope relates to another life and another world. If you google all the references to hope in the New Testament, you will find most of them referring to things like the resurrection or the return of Christ, times when all the good guys will be rewarded and all the bad guys will face God\u0026rsquo;s judgment. From time to time that happens in this life; but mostly what we see now is bad guys triumphing and good guys suffering. Hope leads us to appreciate the promises that Jesus gave about life after death and about him eventually returning to earth, to set things right. One foot planted in the world as it is, and the other planted in the world as it should be.\nBut hope alters the way we live here and now too. Every time that we pray for help with our own battles, we are hoping that God will vindicate us. And some (most notably political activists) go so far as to seek justice for others, besides themselves, as well. They do it because they have hope that something can be done to change the course of history, even though experience shows that the change is often very slight.\nI know that a lot of evangelicals say to forget the needs of the poor, etc. because our efforts will never bring the kind of changes that we imagine will come when Jesus returns; but you will probably not find one of them who does not at least ask for a little help from God when they themselves are in dire straits. We all exercise some measure of hope for peace and justice in this life, even if it may never come.\nSo much that is good in the world (an end to slavery, programs for drug addicts, aid for people suffering from disasters, cures for various diseases, etc.) came because people believed that they could make a difference here and now. People turned away from seeking only their own welfare, and dedicated their lives to helping others\u0026hellip; trying to make at least one small portion of the world more like it \u0026ldquo;should be\u0026rdquo;.\nMany young idealists have fallen away as they have aged; and I have heard that it is common for pastors and priests to go through a similar disillusionment over time… when they have seen that their own efforts did not usher in the dramatic changes that they had hoped for. This disillusionment (whether by spiritual leaders or just the rank and file) often takes the form of cynicism, where people focus mostly on the failures, often to the exclusion of what good has come their way as well. That is hardly an improvement on the dishonesty that comes when one chooses to block out the bitter realities of their own shortcomings, and the bits that don\u0026rsquo;t seem to measure up to what we had hoped for, claiming in the face of evidence to the contrary, that others need only do such and such and all will be well. While the religious zealots ignore the flaws, the cynics ignore all signs of progress.\nBut there is something else that I have noticed about hope. There seems to be an obvious similarity between hope and faith. In Hebrews 11, we are told that faith is \u0026ldquo;the substance of things hoped for; the evidence of things not seen.\u0026rdquo; In other words, even faith has to cope with apparent failure and contradictions at times. Nevertheless faith is usually supported by evidence in other areas. We see, for example, that the world and all that is in it is so intricate and beautiful that it must have come from some unfathomable Designer. And out of this, we profess faith in a Creator God. We can\u0026rsquo;t see that Creator Himself; but we do have, in his creations, some pretty convincing reasons for believing He exists.\nFaith needs to fall back on hope, however, when evidence starts to go against what we would like to believe. When we pray earnestly for something and it does not come; when injustices seem to go unhindered; when stuff we read in the Bible does not line up with stuff we experience in our everyday lives… then we can choose to throw it all out; or we can hope that it\u0026rsquo;s just some error in our own understanding. We can hope that it will one day make sense in a way that it does not now. We can hope that, in another life, everything will be put right.\nSomeone has said, \u0026ldquo;I believe in God, because he does not stand to reason.\u0026rdquo; When trials come, it often challenges our reason to the point where we do not have answers. We are overwhelmed, it seems, by the forces of darkness. And yet hope raises its head out of the darkness and says, \u0026ldquo;I want to believe anyway… whether or not it stands to reason.\u0026rdquo;\nAtheists and agnostics are not so far from the truth when they say that many believers seem to \u0026ldquo;need\u0026rdquo; God to fill in the gaps in their lives. There does seem to be a universal need for us to believe that life has a purpose, even when we don\u0026rsquo;t have a clue what that purpose might be. If God were not real, it would be necessary for us to invent him, because our whole being cries out for an explanation which only a Supreme Power can provide. A Source, a Creator, a Judge, a Rewarder.\nAnd so, hope springs eternal. It keeps speaking up for the existence of a personal God, even when everything else seems to be saying for us to give up, to stop believing, to stop loving, to just take care of number one and live like the animals. Hope brings us back to the centre of our existence.\nThe verse from Corinthians says, \u0026ldquo;And now abides faith, hope, and love; but the greatest of these is love.\u0026rdquo; Very true. But the one that is there when love and faith do not produce the fruit that we would like to see, the one that brings the others back to life when they seem to be fading, is still hope. In recognising that, I believe we can become more mature in our faith, and more effective in our love. When people reject our faith, and spurn our love, we may still have a chance to build God\u0026rsquo;s eternal kingdom by encouraging ourselves (if not them) to hang onto hope… for a better world and a better understanding one day.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/jobs-list-budgets-and-schedules/","title":"Job List, Budgets, and Schedules","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/Budgets_hu_ff48857b0fb20652.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"236\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/Budgets_hu_1b5399c5d947f51d.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/Budgets_hu_7ad57b5e7290f5e7.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/Budgets_hu_ba1890435ef9a754.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Top Forty","tags":"Guidance, Practical","content":"One of the best inventions in history must be that of daily schedules. Wristwatches (especially, cheap wristwatches) must be the next best invention. They made it possible for virtually everyone to co-ordinate their various schedules, so that people could arrange to be in the same place at the same time.\nToday, it would be unthinkable for a company executive to try to operate without a daily schedule (or a wristwatch). Similarly, it would be unthinkable for a company to operate without keeping a budget. Such a budget would not only record what they spend, but would also set limits on what they would be allowed to spend.\nYet, in spiritual situations like our own, there seems to be an almost superhuman resistance to keeping schedules, budgets, or personal job lists.\nI believe the reason for this overwhelming pressure to do away with such things is that people, in general, do not want to be accountable. They don\u0026rsquo;t have much choice when it comes to their jobs, or to government regulations, and so they conform in those areas, even if they do so grudgingly. But in spiritual matters, it is far easier to at least think you can get away with not being accountable, because God doesn\u0026rsquo;t immediately slap you in jail for failing to do what he has told you to do.\nThe devil works in a thousand different ways to make people rebel against accountability. Keeping them from making a list or some other objective measurement of their progress is one of the best ways to do that.\nThe arguments against such discipline always sound \u0026lsquo;spiritual\u0026rsquo;. People argue that they want to be \u0026lsquo;spontaneous\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;flexible\u0026rsquo;; and they don\u0026rsquo;t want to be under the \u0026rsquo;law\u0026rsquo;. But the fruit of such an approach is pathetic, no matter what area of life you are considering.\nPentecostals are probably one of the worst groups of offenders in this area; and of all the various denominations, they also have one of the worst records with regard to unpaid debts, mental illness, and broken marriages amongst their membership.\nAmongst Pentecostals, there are individuals and churches which try hard to overcome these deficits in their members, and they are to be commended for it. But they will never succeed if they accept a theology which justifies lack of accountability with regard to how we use our time and money. I believe that Pentecostals (or people of any other persuasion) who are genuinely trying to teach accountability, will applaud the overall message that we are trying to communicate through this study.\nA number of our own community members have confided that they have a secret fantasy about a Bohemian or New Age type utopia where there are no rules, and yet everything works smoothly. This is the image that many people have when they first approach the idea of living in a Christian commune like our own. They want a world where everyone is nice to them, but where they don\u0026rsquo;t have to make the same sacrifices to be nice in return. It is the number one reason why communes fail. Until we see where the Bohemian fantasy is leading, we will be forever double-minded about all the routine disciplines of living in a successful community. Things like budgets, schedules, and job lists will be left undone, or we will cheat on them whenever we get the chance.\nJesus said of his followers that their righteousness needed to exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees. No one has ever been more spiritual than Jesus; and yet he (and his followers) were also extremely disciplined\u0026hellip; even to the point of laying down their lives for God and for others. He wants us to follow that example of discipline today, in order for our righteousness to exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees.\nWe have said in the past that our time is our life, and if we want to give our lives to God, then we must be willing to give him our time. Making a schedule or a job list is one way to measure just how much progress you are making in that direction. There really is nothing spiritually beneficial about spacing out and wasting time. It is one of the most insidious forms of suicide that the devil has ever devised. People go for hours, days, and finally years without really achieving anything, because they convince themselves that all God wants is for them to be undisciplined. Don\u0026rsquo;t believe it. God is looking for \u0026ldquo;disciples\u0026rdquo; (i.e. \u0026ldquo;disciplined\u0026rdquo; people) and not for smiley airheads who wander around in a constant state of spiritual confusion.\nIf you see someone teaching anarchy, for example, but they seem to have their lives, their families, and maybe even their organisations together; then you can be sure that it did not come as a result of practising the anarchy that they preach. It came from discipline. It came from making lists of things that needed to be done, and then checking those lists to see if they had been accomplished. It came from setting goals, and then assessing whether or not they were reached. It came from making schedules, and then sticking to them (unless there was a genuine justification for making an exception). It came from keeping a budget and paying bills on time. It came from living within their means. You don\u0026rsquo;t learn these sort of things from living in hippy communes. You learn them from other people who make you accountable. Parents who do not discipline their children will never raise children who are just naturally and spontaneously disciplined. If their children learn discipline at all, they will have to learn it from teachers who discipline them, employers who discipline them, military leaders who discipline them, or penal institutions that discipline them.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure where we fit in on this list. Some see us as a family, and others see us as a prison. But either way, we are trying to teach our members discipline. Setting targets and making resolutions, and then keeping a record of how successful you have been in achieving your aims, is just one of many ways that we try to make people accountable for their spiritual progress. There are always aspects of spiritual growth which cannot be measured and which are purely between you and God. But wherever we can objectify progress, we seek to measure it. And the fruit of this approach has been greater progress.\nAsk yourself whether you are praying more now than you did a year ago. Ask yourself if you are reading your Bible more. If you are getting along with other people better. If you are reaching more people for Christ. If you are doing more to help the poor. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like these questions, make some of your own. Set goals for yourself, and then keep an account, to determine whether or not you are making progress. The Bible says that if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged. And one of the best ways to do it is through such things as budgets, schedules, and job lists.

And getting people to actually say the things that are said in the sinner\u0026rsquo;s prayer is a very good exercise. I just wish that we could get them to continue saying those things. Our complaint about the prayer is more that it tends to become a once-and-for-all ritual, that exempts people from continuing to grow in their faith.\nThe thought I want to express in this article is our need to do exactly what people do when they say the sinner\u0026rsquo;s prayer. They put words to something that could easily just pass momentarily through their minds, and then be lost. By putting words to the thought, they become more committed to what may have easily died out. If you are sorry for something, don\u0026rsquo;t just be sorry. Say it; and while you are at it, ask for forgiveness. If you want to follow Jesus, don\u0026rsquo;t just assume that wishful thinking will cause you to do that. Say it, to him and to others. And if you recognise your need for his help, then say that too, and express your willingness to co-operate with him as he tries to help you in your spiritual walk.\nIt is said that the path to hell is paved with good intentions. Sometimes the first step in turning those good intentions into reality is for us to just voice those good thoughts; and when we do this through prayer, it becomes the substance that cements our relationship with God.\nSimply saying, \u0026ldquo;God I want to do the right thing. Please help me\u0026rdquo; has a way of making us more committed to acting on what may otherwise have been nothing more than good intentions. And saying it regularly, whether daily or hourly, will have positive effects in how you live.\nThis principle works in other areas of life as well. I can, for example, have many positive thoughts about friends and relatives, but if I don\u0026rsquo;t ever get around to expressing them, the relationship suffers because of it. If you have a positive thought about someone, it will be ten times more effective if you just say it. That reinforces in the minds of both of you that you really do appreciate the person, and that you are working on having a good relationship. When you are grumpy, or even when you have a valid criticism to make, it will be far less likely to threaten the relationship if you have previously expressed your positive thoughts toward the same people.\nAnd the same is true of our relationship with God. I personally don\u0026rsquo;t know of any better prayer than the one that Jesus prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane, when he said, \u0026ldquo;Thy will be done.\u0026rdquo; Each time I think of something to ask for from God, I realise that nothing else matters half so much as that God\u0026rsquo;s will be done. He knows what is best for me, and ultimately that is what I want. But after you\u0026rsquo;ve prayed that same prayer a thousand times, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to think that even that much doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be said. \u0026ldquo;God knows my heart,\u0026rdquo; we say, and because of that, we can end up taking for granted the fact that we want God\u0026rsquo;s will to be done in our lives.\nBacksliding usually starts with a falling away in our prayer life. We stop saying it, and it isn\u0026rsquo;t long before we stop thinking it, and eventually it isn\u0026rsquo;t our desire at all, because we have become so full of our own will and so full of doing our own thing that God is little more than a word in a book.\nSo even if you\u0026rsquo;ve said it a million times before, keep on saying it. \u0026ldquo;Thy will be done.\u0026rdquo; And while you\u0026rsquo;re at it, you can say the rest of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer as well. When you do, you will discover that the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer and the Sinner\u0026rsquo;s Prayer are basically the same\u0026hellip; except that it is more acceptable for people to keep on saying the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer.\nReciting the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer can be a meaningless ritual, and no doubt it is for many. But I have found in recent years that it contains all of the things that I most want and need in my Christian walk. And yet if I don\u0026rsquo;t say those things at least daily, they can fade from my attention, and I can become distracted and more involved in lesser things. I don\u0026rsquo;t often say the exact words from the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer when I pray, but I do use it as my outline.\n\u0026ldquo;Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\u0026rdquo; Do you want God to be worshipped and honoured? Do you love him yourself, and worship him? Then say it to him every day. He wants to hear you saying that.\n\u0026ldquo;Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\u0026rdquo; Do you want God\u0026rsquo;s will\u0026hellip; in your life and in the lives of others? Then say it, and it will make you more attentive to ways that you can conform to his will and contribute to building his kingdom. Nothing matters more in your life and the entire history of the human race than the building of God\u0026rsquo;s eternal kingdom of love and faith.\n\u0026ldquo;Give us this day our daily bread.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s the line that can most easily be left out in our affluent Western society. But if there are any genuine physical needs that you have, then they need to be placed before God and faced with the knowledge that he is in control of your life. Preceded as it is by a prayer for God\u0026rsquo;s will above all else, you do not need to be afraid to ask if you have a need. Just say it, and know that when you do, God hears it.\n\u0026ldquo;Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.\u0026rdquo; We all need forgiveness every day, as we continually fall short of our full potential. We all need more love for others too. If you really want those things, do not be slack about saying it. And in saying it as it is expressed here, we are reminded of the relationship between our love for others and God\u0026rsquo;s love for us. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the best reminders in the world for getting us down off some high horse of supposed religious superiority.\n\u0026ldquo;Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\u0026rdquo; I cannot imagine anyone ever backsliding if they would just say (and mean) those words every day of their lives. God is faithful to keep us on the right track when we are humble enough to ask him for such protection. Backsliding happens when we think we know more than God, and we start using human reasoning and trivial excuses for sinfulness in some area of our lives. If you want to do what is right, then say it, and say it over and over. Acknowledge your need for God\u0026rsquo;s help in keeping you honest and humble and loving. Those who hunger and thirst after doing what is right will do it\u0026hellip; providing they keep on asking for God\u0026rsquo;s help.\n\u0026ldquo;For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.\u0026rdquo; We end up right back where we started, and that is praising God. But in particular, we are reminded that it is God who calls the shots, and God who should get the credit for everything good in our lives. If you believe that, then say it, and when you do, you will find yourself in exactly the right position to be used by God.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/learning-to-see/","title":"Learning To See","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/LearnSee_hu_8f539b197357b9cf.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"251\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/LearnSee_hu_d5db31849bc4373f.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/LearnSee_hu_6130cea01f768501.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/LearnSee_hu_a53d31722d1f466a.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Top Forty","tags":"Guidance","content":"Part One \u0026ldquo;If the people cannot see where they are going, they will die.\u0026rdquo; (Proverbs 29:18)\nPeople can see that they are part of a big plan. It is the way that people think; and it is how we are different from animals. When we see a thing, we understand that it has a past and a future, and we often think about that. We try to put it together with a bigger picture of what is happening.\nThere are times when we do not know what the big plan is. When this happens, we do things without knowing why we are doing them. In a way, we are acting like we are crazy when we do this. (Romans 1:28) People with this problem will, at times, do things like counting pages in a book, or walking around and around the streets without knowing where they are going. Other people with a mind sickness act in an opposite way, where they do not do anything. They become very sad about their lives, because they do not know what they should do. Often they will end up killing themselves. They are like the people in the saying at the start of this study: They cannot see where they are going, and they feel like they want to die. Some of them do kill themselves.\nMost people in the world do much the same thing with their lives. (Haggai 1:6) But, because they use their time to make money, the doctors will not say that they are sick.\nSome people use their whole lives trying to be good in a sport, and they do not stop to think about why this is important to them, or if it really should be important. They do not stop to ask themselves if this is what life is really about.\nSome people use their lives to make their country look good, but they do not look at the bigger plan for the whole world. They forget that adding to their own country often takes away from other countries.\nOthers work hard to find more people who will join their religion. They finish up fighting with other people who are trying to do the same thing for their religion. These people, too, need to see a bigger plan.\nWe believe that there is a big plan that will help the whole world, and it will make every part of our lives work together well. Truth can come in many shapes, but all of the shapes will fit together into this one big whole. Sadly, the world today is full of people who cannot see the bigger picture. They are like blind men who argue over the little pieces of truth that they have. (Matthew 15:14)\nFive blind men tried to talk about elephants. One touched the tail and said an elephant is like a rope. One touched a leg and said an elephant is like a tree. One touched an ear and said an elephant is like a blanket. One touched the stomach and said an elephant is like a wall. And one touched the nose and said an elephant is like a very big snake. They were all right, but they did not listen to each other to see the whole truth. They were blind to the bigger picture.\nIf we are honest and humble, we will see that we do not have all of the answers. When we are honest about this, we will learn more than the people who think they know it all, and who do not listen to others because of it.\nIf you are a leader, ask questions to see if your followers can see the truth that you have been trying to show them. Some followers agree with the group without understanding why the group is doing what it is doing. Many religious groups had a very good reason for starting, but after a short time, people in the group started working for the group and not for the reasons that the group had when it first started.\nJesus talked about an invisible group (or kingdom) that no one can see. (Luke 17:20-21) He said that this was the plan that he was trying to teach us to finish. Today people fight and kill, and they say that they are working for this invisible kingdom. But an honest person can see that they are only working for their religion. The invisible group that Jesus was talking about was not a religion. (John 4:21-24; Romans 14:17-20) If you really want to know the truth, you will not be happy with a little piece of truth from one group. You will want to see more and more of the pieces, and you will want to put them together to help you see the plan for the whole world, and for all of life. (Philippians 3:12-14)\nWhat is your reason for living? Are there some questions that you do not have answers for? Will you listen if someone has answers for your questions?\nWhen you can see that you do not have all of the answers, it is the first step in finding the answers. If you want to see better, the first step is to know that you do not see as well as you would like to see. (John 9:41)\nIt is good to talk to other people about the questions that you do not have answers for. (James 5:16) You may want to talk to us. We will try to help without saying that we have all the answers.\nPart Two We use the word \u0026ldquo;vision\u0026rdquo; for the ability to see. And we use it for a person\u0026rsquo;s plan for the future and their understanding of the present. What you do today should be a part of a bigger plan for your life. In this part of the study, we will tell about what we believe is the biggest picture. This picture will give us the answer to why we are living on this planet. Our little plans can change from day to day, but if they all go toward this one big plan, our lives will be full and interesting.\nOur vision starts with a Maker. We do not know how the Maker himself started. Our picture is not that big! But we do know that all of us and the world we live in were made. (Hebrews 11:1-3) The Maker must be smarter than the things that he has made. We believe that he made the world and he made us because he wanted to show his love.\nYou do not need to have a religion to see this. It is something that people see because it is the way that we think. It is what makes us different from animals. (See Part One.) We see things around us, and we know that they were made by some person or some thing. (Romans 1:20) We see that love starts with God the Maker (and not with the things he made), and that he wants us to learn how to give love and to receive love. (1 John 4:16)\nBut something is wrong. (We do not understand everything about how and why this happened, but we will say what we do know about it.) It is difficult for us to remember and think about the invisible (spiritual) world and the invisible God that Jesus talked about, because we cannot see God or his world. But we can see the things that he has made. Because of this, people have started to love the things God has made in the way that they should be loving God himself. (Romans 1:21-25) Many people have started to say that the world itself is their god.\nPeople fight to get more and more of the things that God and other people have made, but this, too, does not make them happy. (James 4:1-3)\nMany people love the things that they have made, in the way that they should love God. The things we make are called idols. (Acts 7:41) God does not want us to love idols in the way that we should love Him. (Exodus 20:4-6)\nThere was a time when a country named Babylon controlled much of the world. In this country, there were many idols. But one thing this country is most remembered for today is that they started making little idols out of gold and other expensive metals, and they called the idols \u0026ldquo;money\u0026rdquo;. (They did not call the money \u0026ldquo;idols\u0026rdquo; at that time, but because people quickly learned to love the money the way that they should love God, it was not long before money had become an idol. See Colossians 3:5) The king and other people who controlled the country agreed to give some of the little gold and silver and copper idols (money) to people if they would work hard for the country.\nOver the years, people have learned to work harder and harder for money. They fight and kill to get more of it. (James 4:1-3) People have started to think that they cannot live without money. The leaders know that this is not true. They know that the money itself cannot feed them or protect them or keep them warm when the weather is cold; but they do not teach this. They want the people to believe that money can do all the things that God, their Maker, really does for them.\nIn their hearts, the people know that they are not doing what God wants them to do. They feel guilty, but they do not want to give away their idols and start working for God.\nReligious leaders teach about many different things, but they will not tell people to leave their idols and to live by faith in God. They tell the people that if they will obey the rules of their religions, it will make them happy. But the rules that the religions make do not stop the people from loving and working for money in the way that they should be loving and working for God. Because of this, the rules do not make them happy. (Romans 7:10)\nWe believe that God, the Maker of all things, used his Son, Jesus Christ, to tell us in the strongest possible way that the only way to be happy is to leave all of our idols (Luke 14:33, Matthew 5:3) and to use our time to help and love others. (John 13:35) If we do this, the Maker of the world and all that is in it, will give us all that we need. (Matthew 6:33, Philippians 4:19) We are doing this, and we are more confident after having tried it, that what Jesus said is true, and that it is what our Maker wants us to do. (John 7:17) Our job now is to tell other people about this. (Mark 16:15, Matthew 28:20)\nOn the whole, the world is blind. It is difficult to get other people to see what we are trying to get them to see, because they cannot see God. (Romans 8:7) But, by believing in Jesus, we will be able to see God, and to help other people to see God. When people see us obeying Jesus, they will be able to see God\u0026rsquo;s love in the loving things that we do. (Matthew 5:16) The greatest love is when we give our lives for others. (John 15:13) If we give our lives for God, some people will start to believe in God again. (1 John 3:16) It is not easy to teach other people about love in this way, but God is helping us, and when we work with him in doing this, we know that we are doing the best thing that anyone can do with their lives. (Matthew 7:13-14)\nOne day Jesus will return to help us teach the world about love. (Acts 1:11) We will be the leaders of the whole world after he returns. (1 Corinthians 6:2) But, before Jesus returns, he says that we will be hated and killed by the idol-lovers. (Matthew 24:9-14) For now, we are giving our lives to God and to others by giving them our time. But in the future, we will be doing it by dying for what we believe.\nAll of this is our \u0026ldquo;vision\u0026rdquo;. It teaches us to understand many other things about life and about the world around us. We understand that God and love and the things that we do not see with our physical eyes are much more real than the things we can see with our physical eyes. (2 Corinthians 5:7, 1 Corinthians 2:9) And we are finding true happiness by living our lives for the things that most other people cannot see.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/live-by-faith/","title":"Living By Faith","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/LBF_hu_4a6a3e2ac6781650.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/LBF_hu_c821bb0e3f3c86ec.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/LBF_hu_4731bc0c915ffa96.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/LBF_hu_b8ccda4e687371bb.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Churches and Theology","tags":"Doctrine, Theology, Living By Faith","content":"This is the third in a series of articles on doctrinal differences between ourselves and The Family. The first two articles were \u0026ldquo;Simple Salvation\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Eternal Salvation\u0026rdquo;.\nWe believe that \u0026ldquo;the just shall live by faith\u0026rdquo;. (Romans 1:16-17, Hebrews 10:38, Galatians 3:11) We\u0026rsquo;re not talking about theological faith; for even the devils believe in the existence of God and know that Jesus is the Son of God. We\u0026rsquo;re talking about the kind of faith in God that leads to faith in what his Son, Jesus, taught. Jesus taught that we will either live our lives in tune with what God wants, or we will live our lives in tune with what will make us money. Any effort to do both at the same time will only result in frustration. (Luke 16:13) The good guys (the \u0026lsquo;just\u0026rsquo;) will live by faith; the bad guys (the \u0026lsquo;unjust\u0026rsquo;) will not.\nIf we are living by faith, then faith in God (not money) will be our motive in all that we do. Even when income results from something we originally decided to do in obedience to Jesus, it is wise to ask ourselves, \u0026ldquo;Would I still do this if there were no money in it?\u0026rdquo;\nWe should do the same with our teachings. If we alter our teaching in order to win the favour of people who have power and wealth, then heresy will result.\nObviously our hard-line position on living by faith being a part of God\u0026rsquo;s plan for salvation has caused a lot of alienation - from our families, the media, governments, the general public, and supporters. The Family seems to be the one other organisation that shares some sympathy with us on this teaching. However, it seems living by faith is not the cornerstone of their teaching that it is with us, and this causes us some concern.\nPlease note: We are prepared to be shown otherwise. It is easy to misjudge motives; and we may be reading too much into certain Family teachings and practices. Nevertheless, here are our observations:\nFrom the start The Family has taught that there are two kinds of Christians - those who obey Jesus, and those who financially support those who obey Jesus. Requirements for discipleship (i.e. Luke 14:33) are waived for the second group, who are, nevertheless, still regarded as Christians.\nWe cannot agree with this teaching. The words \u0026ldquo;Christian\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;disciple\u0026rdquo; are used interchangeably in the Bible. Luke 14:33 is not talking about an elite group of Christians, called \u0026ldquo;disciples\u0026rdquo;. It is talking about \u0026ldquo;whosoever\u0026rdquo; wants to be a Christian, just as John 3:16 is talking about \u0026ldquo;whosoever\u0026rdquo; is going to have eternal life. You are either a disciple of Jesus, or you are not a Christian. There are no neutrals. And the requirement for disciples in Luke 14:33 is just as universal as the requirement in John 3:16.\nWe can understand giving some people the benefit of the doubt if they don\u0026rsquo;t know any better. And Matthew 10:40-42 suggests that God will reward those who help us materially. But the verses preceding this passage (Matthew 10:33-39) suggest that helping a prophet \u0026ldquo;in the name of a prophet\u0026rdquo; means much more than making a donation to our work.\nI have quoted these verses to businessmen who have helped us and said, \u0026ldquo;You can have a blessing after you die, or one on your business now. Which do you prefer?\u0026rdquo; They have opted for a blessing on their business! So their assistance is coming \u0026ldquo;in the name of their business\u0026rdquo;, not in the name of Jesus.\nIt is good to be polite and loving toward people who support us; but we cannot \u0026lsquo;justify\u0026rsquo; them. We have not come to condemn them, but we will never save them if we are not convinced that they are lost in the first place.\nThis area of difference between us and The Family seems to stem from faith in the \u0026ldquo;sinner\u0026rsquo;s prayer\u0026rdquo; as the ultimate test of whether a person is a Christian. A supporter who says the prayer is regarded as a Christian whether or not they obey Jesus by forsaking all. We cannot agree with this, and when supporters discover this, their gifts to us usually stop, indicating that the support was contingent on our justifying their disobedience.\nOur concern is that the sinner\u0026rsquo;s prayer/eternal salvation teachings may have been invented in the first place (not by The Family, but by the churches) as a panacea for all those who want to feel justified without necessarily obeying Jesus. We fear that what The Family has discovered about living by faith is being undermined by a contradictory churchy tradition.\nOur experience with these teachings in the churches has been that eventually they lead to a charge of heresy against anyone, like ourselves, who teaches Luke 14:33.\nThe disobedient (who have said the prayer) are justified (by the churches), and the obedient (who teach that faith must lead to obedience) are accused of heresy. In the end, we are usually forced to choose between Luke 14:33 (including the bulk of what Jesus taught that supports this passage) and a teaching that rests solely on some debateable passages from Paul. To our knowledge, this has, so far, not happened with The Family, and we pray that it never will.\nIf our heresy is that we are teaching that obedience to Jesus is necessary for salvation, we will take our chances on God\u0026rsquo;s grace forgiving us for such a heresy. Such a presumption seems to be far safer than taking our chances on his grace forgiving us for not teaching the necessity of obedience to Jesus.\nAnother difference: Although a large number of Family members \u0026ldquo;live by faith\u0026rdquo; by not working in paid jobs, they occasionally encourage their own members to get jobs to make money for various reasons. It seems that if we start thinking we \u0026ldquo;need\u0026rdquo; money, and especially that we need to sell our time (life) to get it, then we are not expressing faith in God\u0026rsquo;s provision.\nWhere God guides, he provides. If he\u0026rsquo;s not providing, then maybe we\u0026rsquo;re trying to do something he has not asked us to do. We have found that if we just stay faithful with what we have, he brings in more money when he wants us to do something that requires more. He is the king; and he says that if we will seek his kingdom first, he\u0026rsquo;ll pay the bills.\nThis is a good way to keep from \u0026ldquo;getting ahead of God\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;working in the flesh\u0026rdquo;. If he doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide tickets to India, we simply don\u0026rsquo;t go; and our reason on judgment day will be that he didn\u0026rsquo;t provide the tickets. We cannot imagine God punishing us for continuing to witness in Australia while we waited on Him to provide us with the means to go elsewhere. Would he really punish us for not stopping our work for him to work for money for tickets, when he has clearly said that material provision is his job, and not ours (Matthew 6:19-34). Operating this way, we have travelled all over the world on tickets that God has provided. But we have also been faithful about not wasting money on other luxuries.\nIt sounds contradictory to hear people talk of God creating the world, healing people, giving eternal life, and doing other miracles; and then see them turn to worldly employers when they have material needs (John 6:27).\nWhat God needs are labourers in his vineyard - not financial \u0026lsquo;supporters\u0026rsquo;. If we find the labourers, he\u0026rsquo;ll pay the wages. We challenge people from any group or organisation that is complaining about lack of funds to come and work with us. Our Boss owns all the wealth in the world, and we are not short of funds\u0026hellip; only short of workers.\nHaving a little faith is like being a little pregnant: There is no such thing. Either you have faith or you don\u0026rsquo;t have faith. Real faith will lead you to stop working for money and start working for God. If people are moving in that direction, fine. The more we feed them the promises of God, the more their faith will grow. But to teach people that making money is their calling in life is simply not on.\nWe believe that living by faith is the trademark of a true Christian (Galatians 3:11; Romans 1:17; Hebrews 10:38; Matthew 6:31-34). And we believe that Jesus has commanded us to teach others to live by faith as well (Matthew 28:20).\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/living-by-faith---and-how-to-do-it/","title":"Living By Faith - And How to Do It","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/LBFing_hu_daea7442d12049f6.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/LBFing_hu_3aeba36462cee0f4.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/LBFing_hu_83dad3c022782a27.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/LBFing_hu_113263fdef2326e4.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Top Forty","tags":"The Teachings of Jesus, Living By Faith","content":"Jesus Christ taught people not to think about how to feed and clothe themselves.\n(Matthew 6:25-32) He said that if we would work to build his kingdom, God would feed and clothe us. (Matthew 6:33) He called labourers to come and work for him, (Matthew 11:29-30) and not to labour for the \u0026ldquo;food that perishes\u0026rdquo;. (John 6:27) He said that we cannot work for two employers at the same time, and that making money and serving God are mutually exclusive motives for doing things. (Luke 16:13) He said that if we do not leave everything we own, we cannot call ourselves his followers. (Luke 14:33)\nCommon sense tells us that such teachings just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work in today\u0026rsquo;s world. So most of us reject outright what Jesus said.\nYet, if Jesus is really the Son of God, then maybe we ought to put more faith in him than in \u0026ldquo;common sense\u0026rdquo;. Maybe we ought to at least give his teachings a try. The people who prepared this article did, and they found that faith really works\u0026hellip; that God really is alive and active today\u0026hellip; that Jesus Christ not only knew what he was talking about, but that he had the key to solving all of the world\u0026rsquo;s problems. If you would like to practise living by faith, then here are some practical tips, based on our own experiences, and on the teachings of Jesus.\nPRAY The first, and most important, lesson is this: learn to pray. Not long hours of self-torture, or eloquent recitations, but real, gut-level honesty with God\nand with yourself. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to climb out of a boat and try to walk on water, you can\u0026rsquo;t afford to have misplaced faith. You must ask God to show you His will clearly, from the teachings of His Son.\nGod will use many different means to feed and clothe you, and if you are not brutally honest, you will soon be trusting the means more than you trust God. Prayer will help you to stay honest.\nSIMPLIFY The Bible says to be content with food and clothing. (1 Timothy 6:8) Jesus instructed us to pray only for enough food for today. (Luke 11:3) If God gives you literature, musical instruments, vehicles, buildings, computers, or whatever to use for him, that\u0026rsquo;s fine. But you don\u0026rsquo;t have to have these things. People who think they must have such things are always working for something that they decided they needed, instead of getting to work right now with what God has given them to work with.\nIf you have hands, legs, a strong back, a voice, and/or a good mind to use to share God\u0026rsquo;s love with others, then you have more than enough to get started\u0026hellip; right now!\nSELL When you only need enough cash for your daily bread, it\u0026rsquo;s not so difficult to believe that you can survive at least for a while on the resources that you already have. Start selling the things you have, and using the funds for the poor. (Luke 12:32-34) Any time you find yourself without food enough for today, you can classify yourself as \u0026ldquo;poor\u0026rdquo;, and some of the funds can go toward feeding yourself.\nResist the temptation to give your worldly wealth to family and friends, who do not need them. Make the rich pay for your possessions if they want them, and use the proceeds to help those who are really in need, as Jesus commanded. You may find yourself with sufficient funds to assist with things like transport and literature to get this message of living by faith out to other people as well. This, too, is part of what Jesus has told us to do (Mark 16:15)\u0026hellip; as long as you never go into debt to do so (Romans 13:8), and as long as you don\u0026rsquo;t hang onto things because \u0026ldquo;someday\u0026rdquo; you may be able to use them for God. (James 5:2-3)\nGIVE If you are miserly with the funds or possessions you have when you are \u0026ldquo;living by faith\u0026rdquo;, then you aren\u0026rsquo;t really living by faith. Don\u0026rsquo;t be trapped into thinking that everyone else must do the giving now, and you must always be the receiver.\nTry to regularly give something\u0026hellip; secretly\u0026hellip; totally\u0026hellip; (whether or not the recipient deserves it) without any strings attached. Guard against giving in the hope of getting something in return, or to build up a good reputation. It is your secret giving that is the real measure of your faith in God, and it will also be the greatest faith-builder, as you see God himself responding in ways that you had never expected.\nWORK Living by faith should not be a cop-out from social responsibility. You just have a different Employer (God) and a different motive (Love). Be constantly watching and listening for practical ways to show God\u0026rsquo;s love. While others concentrate on jobs that offer prestige or good pay, you can look for where the greatest needs are, then seek to meet them. If you are not working, you are not living by faith. You\u0026rsquo;ll show your faith by your works (James 2:18), and if you refuse to work for your new Employer, you just might find that he refuses to feed you! (2 Thessalonians 3:10)\nASK Greedy people have no shame about asking for ridiculous sums of money for themselves and for their products. So why should God\u0026rsquo;s people, who are ready to give their lives in service to others, feel guilty about asking for help in some small way?\nJesus commanded his disciples, when arriving in a town, to \u0026ldquo;ask who is worthy\u0026rdquo; to help them, and to eat the food and accept the shelter that these people provide. He added: \u0026ldquo;The labourer is worthy of his hire.\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 10:10-11, Luke 10:7-8)\nGreedy people will invariably condemn non-greedy people for being \u0026lsquo;poor\u0026rsquo; (since they judge everyone on the basis of how much money they make). But it\u0026rsquo;s the greedy people who are not worthy of helping us, and we need not soil ourselves by accepting their money. On the other hand, neither should we let them make us feel unworthy when we accept help from people who do appreciate what we are doing.\nSHARE Because love involves a minimum of two people, Jesus only promises that his Spirit will be present where \u0026ldquo;two or three people gather together\u0026rdquo; to promote his cause. (Matthew 18:20)\nOur prayers and our testimonies have far more weight when expressed in company with other Christians. (Matthew 18:19; Luke 10:1; Hebrews 10:28)\nEarly Christians lived together, and shared everything in common. (Acts 2:44-45; Acts 4:32-35) This unity made them stronger corporately, and also made them stronger individuals, because they were able to learn from each other, and to correct one another when errors arose.\nCONCLUSION Well, that\u0026rsquo;s the theory. Now, it\u0026rsquo;s time for you to put it into practice. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t say, in four months I\u0026rsquo;ll begin to harvest. The harvest, indeed, is plentiful, but the labourers are few. Pray that God will send forth labourers into his harvest field.\u0026rdquo; (John 4:35; Matthew 9:37)\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/living-in-community/","title":"Living In Community","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/CommunityLiv_hu_21591047410df71d.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/CommunityLiv_hu_36e2a97c17d17f89.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/CommunityLiv_hu_ed462c3406a801e6.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/CommunityLiv_hu_5f1ecf63fe654104.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Endtime and Sex Issues","tags":"Community, Living By Faith","content":"I have always believed that living in community (as we do, and as the early Christians did) is somewhat optional. It is not commanded (in so many words) in what Jesus taught, although he and his disciples obviously lived together, travelled together, and had a common purse. I have felt strongly about the spiritual benefits of such a lifestyle; but I just didn\u0026rsquo;t think there was a case for making it absolutely essential.\nOf course, the concept of having at least two or three people together when praying, when going on an outreach, or any time we hope to have God\u0026rsquo;s presence (see \u0026ldquo;Two Witnesses\u0026rdquo;) is taught strongly throughout the Bible, and that includes the teachings of Jesus. Because \u0026ldquo;two or three people\u0026rdquo; is all it takes to have a Christian community, living in a community of some sort (even if it\u0026rsquo;s just living in Christian unity with your own spouse) is an important fundamental of the Christian life.\nThe issue becomes even more important in the light of that famous passage in Hebrews, where it says not to forsake living together. (Hebrews 10:25) Living together is what \u0026ldquo;assembling together\u0026rdquo; actually meant. Notice that it goes on to say that we should heed the instruction in that verse \u0026ldquo;so much more as you see that day approaching\u0026rdquo;. In other words, as we get closer to the return of Jesus, it is going to become even more important for us to \u0026ldquo;live together\u0026rdquo;.\nThis presents a bit of a paradox, because the Bible also tells us that the institutional church will become progressively more apostate as we get closer to the return of Jesus.\nObviously, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to become part of the apostate church. But the warning is not to become part of the rebellious world either. What God is going to be doing in the next few years before the return of Jesus, is putting together various \u0026ldquo;tribes\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ve known this for years, and yet I have never claimed to be one of those tribes. In fact, I have cautioned against anyone rushing into some human attempt to hammer together an organisation and then call it the supernatural coming together that the Bible tells us is going to take place in the last days.\nBut I have stopped believing that this coming together is going to be anything like the mythical \u0026ldquo;secret rapture\u0026rdquo; dream that the churches have fallen for. I do not believe it is something that will happen outside our will, and without any effort on our part. What it takes for the twelve tribes of The Revelation to come together is exactly what it takes to follow Jesus, and that is a humble, obedient spirit, that hungers and thirsts after more and more of the truth.\nSuppose you have a hundred people totally lost in a maze, and 90 of the people don\u0026rsquo;t really care. They have picnic lunches with them and they just decide to settle down and enjoy their stay. But there are ten people who desperately need to get out of the maze.\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t it natural to assume that the ten who are genuinely looking for the solution are going to be drawn to one another? Aren\u0026rsquo;t they more likely to find their way out if they share with one another their various experiences with different aspects of the maze? Won\u0026rsquo;t they benefit from an overall plan that would call for different ones to major on different parts of the maze, and to report their findings back to the others, until they can all find their way out?\nSo it amazes me when I come across other people who say they have been trying to find the truth. Some of them even confess that we have helped them in their search. And yet so many of these people show little or no interest in further fellowship. They don\u0026rsquo;t seek us out. They don\u0026rsquo;t ask us to visit. They don\u0026rsquo;t respond to our letters. They just head off on their own.\nIf you ask them, they will tell you all the arguments for why they don\u0026rsquo;t need us. They have God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit themselves. We each need to find God in our own way. They haven\u0026rsquo;t got the kind of faith that we have (or we haven\u0026rsquo;t got the kind of faith that they have), etc.\nIn some cases these people have had fellowship with one or two other people, and on that basis I have tended to shrug my shoulders and say, \u0026ldquo;Oh, well, it\u0026rsquo;s up to you. At least you\u0026rsquo;ve got each other.\u0026rdquo; But over the years, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen even the two and three member teams bust up, and now I am beginning to think that it is because something was wrong back at the start, when they thought that all they needed was two or three. Living in community can start with something as small as two or three; but it should not stop there.\nThe problem is that we should not be trying for the bare minimum. A genuine seeker after truth wants the absolute maximum. Sure, we will never be perfect; but it should not stop us from aiming for perfection. And so, the error is right there when we argue that we do not need other Christians in order to make it into heaven. How much desire for truth have we got when that is our attitude?\nThe question should not be whether or not Christian community is your ticket to salvation, but whether or not Christian community is going to help you to be a better Christian, and help you to be more effective for God. Obviously, it is going to be inconvenient at times. It is going to impinge on your privacy. It is going to test your patience. It is going to restrict your freedom. But at the end of the week, or the end of the year, or at the end of our lives, we need to ask whether or not we got more done and whether we grew stronger spiritually by working as part of a team, or whether we got more done and grew more spiritually by doing our own thing and going our own way.\nThe whole reason for the \u0026ldquo;two or three\u0026rdquo; rule to begin with is that one person on his or her own cannot be much of a testimony of God\u0026rsquo;s love. Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;They will know you are Christians by your love.\u0026rdquo; (John 13:35) The \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rdquo; he is talking to here is not one person. The \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rdquo; has to be at least two or three people. It is as the world sees our love in action, through daily sacrifice for each other that they know we are Christians.\nBut if two or three becomes an excuse to exclude numbers four and five, then the whole formula becomes distorted and sick.\nThe church has its counterfeit Christian communities, which are run by hirelings and populated by self-centered goats who are totally lacking in the most rudimentary Christian graces. But until we show them the genuine thing, the world will never know what real Christianity is all about (and for that matter, neither will we!)\nEvery now and then a loose cannon will roll into town and amaze a lot of people with his or her eccentricities, or with some superficial show of spirituality; but the true fellowship of believers who are willing to literally lay down their lives for one another day after day and year after year, cannot even be imagined by the world until we start living it ourselves.\nLet me talk about these twelve tribes in The Revelation for a moment. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any instructions from God about how they are going to be worked out, or who is going to lead any of them. But I do have instructions from God about how Christians are supposed to be living right now, and some of these instructions are part and parcel of becoming part of those twelve tribes. For example, one of the things that Christians are supposed to be doing, is that we are supposed to be sorting out the grievances that exist between us, in love and in truth. It\u0026rsquo;s right there in the teachings of Jesus.\nAnyone who tells me that they are practising the teachings of Jesus, and yet they are not willing to sort out their grievances with other Christians who are practising the teachings of Jesus, is only fooling themselves. And I can apply that in any direction you like.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s apply it to the churches. The grievance system calls on us to go to them with our grievances about what is not being done correctly. We have tried to do it, and they will not let us. We are not saying that they have to say we are right. But we are saying that there needs to be a mechanism for such grievances to be addressed and dealt with.\nIt is there in the teachings of Jesus. I expect that even if they did allow us to come with a grievance, they would still vote against us in the end. But they don\u0026rsquo;t even want to hear us out, because in the process, we would point out that they are not following the teachings of Jesus (since that is our grievance in the first place), and why should they let their people hear us saying something like that about them when it is so obviously true, and when our cause is so obviously right? Because they hate the light and run from the light, and because their deeds are evil, they do with us like they did with Jesus. They seek to shut us up without a hearing. (John 3:19-21)\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s apply the grievance principles to the various \u0026ldquo;independents\u0026rdquo; who say that they are trying to get back to the truth. We are not going to get back to the truth if each one of us becomes a law unto ourselves, making and changing the rules to suit ourselves and our own selfish whims. We must each be willing to \u0026ldquo;fall on the rock\u0026rdquo; of Christ\u0026rsquo;s teachings and be broken by them. Each of our thoughts, words, plans, and actions needs to be subject to the teachings of Jesus. And Jesus tells us to talk out our differences, through grievance meetings.\nThe Bible says, \u0026ldquo;How can you say you love God, whom you haven\u0026rsquo;t seen, if you hate your brother, whom you have seen?\u0026rdquo; (1 John 4:20) Some will say that they do not \u0026ldquo;hate\u0026rdquo; us; and yet they run away from fellowship, and especially from the very thought of living with us.\nIf we have done something wrong, then have the courage to take a grievance against us. If we refuse to hear you out, then make the grievance public (under conditions where we are free to hear and respond to whatever charges you make as well). But don\u0026rsquo;t be so hypocritical as to pretend that you love us when you cannot do that.\nThe message in these last days is for Christians to forsake all and live by faith. But it is more than that. It is that we learn to live in community. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be with us; but it does have to be with a community that is also willing to work out its differences with us. We must end this isolationism that has made what few radicals there are for Jesus into largely ineffectual conversation pieces.\nJesus prayed that his followers would be one, so that the world would believe. (John 17:11) The world is not going to be impressed with whatever stunts we get up to on our own. Neither are they going to be impressed with the political empire building that is going on in the name of ecumenicalism. But they will be impressed with a worldwide fellowship of people who have stopped running from the truth, and who have learned to lay their pride on the line along with their wealth, reputation, plans, and ambitions, in order to be used by God.\nBetween where we stand now, and where we will stand when Jesus brings together his army of 144,000 faithful spiritual warriors there lies a lot of uncharted ocean. But I know for a certainty that somewhere on that journey we are going to have to sail through a very narrow strait that makes the demands on us that living in community makes. Are you prepared to head into those waters?\n\u0026ldquo;Enter in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat. Because strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it.\u0026rdquo; Matthew 7:13-14\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/may-your-kingdom-come/","title":"May Your Kingdom Come","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/KingCome_hu_e62445012b0287fa.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"630\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/KingCome_hu_833ee9749507be57.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/KingCome_hu_466d685237dffff7.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/KingCome_hu_5b84a58b44b907a1.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Endtime and Sex Issues","tags":"The Kingdom of Heaven, Prophesy","content":"As people with a serious concern for the welfare of this planet, the return of Christ offers us hope.\nEarth at the moment has a jinx on it.

He calls on us to practice these principles in our own lives, but assures us that the same world that killed Jesus for his beliefs will eventually kill us. In other words, we have been given all the necessary theory\u0026hellip; but not the means to put it into practice on a large scale.\nThis dilemma is part of an ingenious recruiting system for the leaders of the new world.

If I can do something you have no explanation for, does that make me spiritually superior to you? What is a miracle anyway? These are just a few of the questions which have perplexed me as I have tried to understand what my position should be with regard to the supernatural.\nIn this age of technological wonders, it is sad that nominal Christians so often choose to put their faith in miracles rather than in a God who just happens to do things that no human being can understand.\nJesus said, \u0026ldquo;Evil people seek miracles, but no miracle will be given to them except the miracle of Jonah.\u0026rdquo; (Luke 11:29-32) He goes on to say that Jonah\u0026rsquo;s message was proof that he was right, just as Solomon\u0026rsquo;s wisdom was enough to bring the Queen of Sheba all the way from Africa to listen to him.\nSo, with or without miracles, God is looking for people who will stay true to certain principles contained in the message that Jesus delivered.

Or, as Paul put it, the preaching of the cross is, to them, foolishness.\nThe Bible tells us that there is a coming world ruler who will deceive the world through dishonest miracles. (II Thessalonians 2:9-11) It says that he will only be able to do this because the masses will have already rejected the truth.\nWhat an accurate picture of so many today: There is a significant section of the church world today which has rejected much of the truth in the teachings of Jesus, and has replaced it with promises of miracles.\nThe Pentecostal movement relies strongly on a misinterpretation of the final verse of Mark\u0026rsquo;s gospel. In this passage, Jesus orders his disciples to go to all the world preaching the gospel; and he promises that miracles will \u0026ldquo;follow them that believe\u0026rdquo;.\nAsk yourself, \u0026ldquo;What is my part of the contract? and what is God\u0026rsquo;s part?\u0026rdquo; Jesus is not commanding us to do miracles in this passage. But he does promise that miracles will happen if we do our part. And our part is to \u0026ldquo;preach the gospel\u0026rdquo;.\nIf miracles aren\u0026rsquo;t happening, it\u0026rsquo;s probably because we aren\u0026rsquo;t preaching the gospel. (We won\u0026rsquo;t go into details here on what preaching the gospel means. You can read about that in such articles as Living by Faith: How to Do It, and Fingers in Their Ears.)\nJesus said that we would do greater works than he did. What could be greater than raising the dead? Giving eternal life, of course\u0026ndash;something that not even Jesus himself could give until after his sacrificial death.\nBut eternal life does not have the here-and-now excitement that an evil world seeks; and so it has been replaced by sensationalism, and lying signs and wonders.\nAs believers, we have had a few experiences that escape natural explanation\u0026hellip; experiences that we cannot label as anything short of miraculous. But the bigger picture is that we\u0026rsquo;ve never been able to find a simple formula for harnessing God and getting him to act when and how we tell him to. So our primary emphasis has been on \u0026ldquo;preaching the gospel\u0026rdquo; the way he told us to; and then we just thank him for any miracles that follow as a result.\nRemember, God won\u0026rsquo;t judge us by how many miracles we experience, but rather by how faithfully we obey him.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/my-love-for-leftovers/","title":"My Love For Leftovers","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/lefto/leftovers_hu_80bbe5698737f0c3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/lefto\\/leftovers_hu_c290e7c0940d7062.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/lefto/leftovers_hu_627100e3cb769b96.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/lefto\\/leftovers_hu_edbd8d3d7b73d202.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Leftovers","tags":"Practical","content":"I have often heard people complaining about having to eat \u0026ldquo;leftovers\u0026rdquo;. It baffles me, because it is said as though there is something inferior about leftovers. Food that was absolutely delicious the night before suddenly gets this terrible reputation the next day.\nPerhaps as a reaction to that, I have developed a kind of lifelong obsession for eating leftovers. I have noticed that it is an obsession which extends to a great many other things as well. I hate to see anything go to waste, and I realise that most people have an aversion to using leftovers, remnants, off-cuts, the last little bit at the bottom of the jar, etc. So the more little bits that I can put to good use, the more satisfied that I feel.\nA fringe benefit of using the leftovers is tidiness\u0026hellip; and even a look of wealth. The refrigerator has more room for full bottles of milk and whole cartons of eggs. Instead of half a dozen jars with a little bit of jam at the bottom of each, there is one almost new, almost full jar.\nJunk becomes recycled, while the best items are available for others, or to be sold.\nThere are even leftovers with regard to jobs. (I\u0026rsquo;m not as good on this one, but Cherry makes up for me here.) Most people walk away from a job with a few loose ends still hanging, whereas the leftover lovers put the finishing touches on what others leave half-done. They put the tools away, wipe up the muddy footprints, scrub the ring off the bathtub, pick up dirty clothes, and just generally clean up behind those who grab the easy bits and then leave the rest.\nOften the task of finishing off leftovers is overwhelming, especially in a wealthy society. Everywhere there are leftovers cluttering shelves, rooms, and the landscape. Everywhere there are unfinished tasks, because some new interest caught the attention of the person who was doing it.\nI am sure that some people will consider it trivial and unnecessary for me to even be writing this; but I do believe that there is an important spiritual lesson here, about being faithful in little things before God can make us rulers over bigger things.\nJames said, in his epistle, \u0026ldquo;Go to [That\u0026rsquo;s Old English for \u0026ldquo;shame on you\u0026rdquo;.] you rich men, for your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. You have heaped treasure together for the last days.\u0026rdquo; (James 5:1-3)\nWhether we think of ourselves as rich or not, if we have more possessions (or more jobs) than we can maintain, then we need to simplify. That may mean cleaning up, fixing up, using up, or just plain giving or throwing away the rusty bits, the moth-eaten bits, the mouldy bits, the messy bits, and the leftover bits. When it comes to jobs, we need to sort out our priorities, and make sure we have totally finished the most important ones before we run off to start others. We should be able to present each finished task to God as an offering of praise, something that we can say with confidence has been completed to at least near perfection. No loose ends, nothing left for others to finish for us.\nI love a finished work, even if it\u0026rsquo;s just finishing off the last of a jar of mayonnaise, or putting the final touches on a painting. But there are so many unfinished tasks in the world, that I pray for more such labourers.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/new-economic-policy/","title":"New Economic Policy","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/NEP_hu_a5b0dbabfff3bd85.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/NEP_hu_9cc357c39a691cfc.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/NEP_hu_1773375a86155043.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/NEP_hu_6d7d4e1ab4bfa123.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Top Forty","tags":"Economy, The Kingdom of Heaven","content":"Anyone knows that material wealth is measured in goods: apples, cars, shoes, sheep, etc. When the number and the quality of these things increases, wealth increases.\nBut economists disagree. They say they can make wealth by destroying goods or by producing fewer goods of poorer quality.\nIf we would use the technology, labour, and resources that are now available to us, the entire planet could enjoy an amazingly high standard of living. But the experts say it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be good for the economy. Why?\nBecause the economists work for the rich and not for the poor. They are only interested in higher profits for the sellers\u0026hellip; even if it means fewer sales at a higher price.\nBusinessmen may make more money by destroying half their crop and tripling their prices. Half the population may go hungry, but economists will say they have increased the wealth of the country. Do you see a flaw in their thinking?\nThe flaw is that they have confused money with wealth. And hardly anyone in the world dares to correct that error. But think about it: You can\u0026rsquo;t eat money. It will not keep you warm. It is only useful if you can trade it for something else.\nBut if we continue with our present economic policies, there will be less and less to trade it for.\nWHAT IS MONEY? Before money existed, people were still greedy. But there were limits to their greed. When you traded chickens for sacks of wheat, there were limits to how many chickens you could carry home, house, and maintain.\nTrue, some had more than others, but it was unthinkable that any one person could have a million (much less, a billion) chickens in their back yard. And, if others in your village were starving while you had even a thousand chickens, it was hard to convince the others that you were entitled to a thousand times more than they had.\nThen someone invented money. It was easier to carry, store, maintain, and especially easier to hide. With enough money, you could own the world, without actually putting it in your back yard.\nPoor people could work in your factories, shop in your supermarkets, do business in your skyscrapers, even drive on your roads in cars financed by your banks, and never feel angry about how unfair this is.\nNow the rich control the media, education, religion, even the government. They have brainwashed us into believing that they have a right to destroy the world in order to increase their wealth. We now think that whatever is good for BHP is good for all of us.\nWorse still, we have all been tricked into playing their game. We now believe that money is the key to happiness. The entire human race has lost touch with reality in our obsession with money as an end in itself. This is madness!\nWORK VS. PLAY The struggle for more money does not only hurt the losers - the poor. It also hurts the winners, by making their work life a miserable existence\u0026hellip; a rat race!\nMusicians, actors, athletes, and kids play. Others work. But what is the difference? The general rule is that \u0026ldquo;players\u0026rdquo; do not receive wages for what they freely choose to do, and \u0026ldquo;workers\u0026rdquo; do. And with increased leisure, people are learning to make \u0026ldquo;play\u0026rdquo; out of many activities.\nPrisoners study law; grandmothers take up flying; uni students enter campus politics; businessmen start hobby farms. And they do this with no promise of pay for their efforts. Are they working or are they playing?\nThey are \u0026ldquo;plorking\u0026rdquo; (pronounced plurking). Plorking is a combination of playing and working. It means being creative, productive, or useful without being concerned about receiving money for it.\nSome people enjoy their jobs and would not trade them for anything. These lucky plorkers (who just happen to be paid for it) are more reliable, more dedicated, and more contented than their workmates.\nIf everyone did the things they wanted to do, everyone would be more productive, and society would be richer for it.\nBut the money myth has convinced people that they must spend their lives making money rather than being happy and productive.\nPeople who cannot find a way to make money (or who aren\u0026rsquo;t interested in making money) are made to feel they are useless. Worse than that, they are told that they have sinned against the world that feeds them until they begin to make money again. No thought at all is given to how creative, useful, or productive the non-wage earners may be.\nIf players are the best workers, then more effort should be made to encourage people to play, instead of condemning the few who do.\nWHERE DO WARS COME FROM? To most people, we fight wars because people in another country are evil and we (the good people) must stop them. But it isn\u0026rsquo;t really that simple.\nRemember that people in the other country are being told the same things about us!\nGreed is the great weakness of capitalism; but it is also the great weakness of socialism. Both sides are trying to destroy the other for the same reason\u0026hellip; greed. Wars are just an extension of the greed that operates within every strata of society. But it is easier to see the utter foolishness of such motivation when we look at the devastation of war.\nTragically, the rich on both sides do not fight their own wars. Instead, they sacrifice the lives of the poor in their quest for more power.\nThe same conflicts go on within our country, in the form of running battles between employers and employees. And it even operates on the family and individual level in the form of almost constant arguing and malice.\nHatred between the sexes, racism, generation gaps, are all self-destructive. And they all come from a desire to explain the emptiness greed has left in our own spirits, by blaming someone else.\nFor your own sanity, for unity in your family, for prosperity in your country, and for the survival of the human race, someone must begin to declare war on greed\u0026hellip; before we all destroy ourselves!\nA NEW MOTIVATION Although there was a lot of criticism of the space race during the 1960\u0026rsquo;s and the 1970\u0026rsquo;s, it was fulfilling a human need in a much more positive way than Vietnam. Kennedy\u0026rsquo;s Peace Corps offered hopes of being an even better alternative to war. (Of course, these programs were only as successful as the zeal of the masses allowed. Personal inventiveness, adventure, and love do not depend on support from the government.)\nThe human spirit enjoys a challenge. If we are not actively building, we are actively destroying. Too often we think the way to build ourselves up is to tear someone else down.\nWhat is needed is a vision and a commitment that are both positive and complete. We believe the goal must be total love\u0026hellip; for all mankind. Our aggression must be directed against the lies and deceptions that are destroying the world (but not against the people who tell and believe the lies).\nWe are talking about more than nice words for a political platform or a new religion. We are talking about a community of people who refuse to let money be a motivation for their daily living\u0026hellip; people who actively seek every day to use all of their skills, energy, and resources to express love for others.\nIn time we hope to see this spirit of love spread and affect others. Real love is much more than emotional thrills; it is capable of ushering in a whole new world order. In fact, we\u0026rsquo;ve found it is more powerful than life itself.\nA few of us have begun to work for love rather than for money. We have given up everything we own and we are prepared to die for love.\nWe have already found that such commitment pays dividends in terms of inner fulfilment, increased awareness, and a zest for life. We believe we\u0026rsquo;ve hit on the answer to the world\u0026rsquo;s problems.\nTHE SOURCE This is always the hardest part to get across: The things in this booklet really came from the teachings of Jesus Christ. That\u0026rsquo;s right; we\u0026rsquo;re Christians.\nPlease don\u0026rsquo;t confuse us with all that passes for Christianity today. Jesus said some amazing things, if people would just take him seriously. He called this new economic police the \u0026ldquo;good news of the kingdom of God.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to bring God into it for a couple of reasons.\nFor one thing, if we\u0026rsquo;re not careful, we can end up letting go of money and then fighting over the things it can buy. Just as goods are more important than money, so God is more important than the goods. He\u0026rsquo;s the source of all true wealth.\nThe obvious argument, \u0026ldquo;If we don\u0026rsquo;t look after ourselves, who will?\u0026rdquo; has an answer when you bring God into it. If you\u0026rsquo;re working for love, you\u0026rsquo;re working for God. It becomes his responsibility to look after your material needs. And we\u0026rsquo;ve found that he does!\nAlso, God comes into it when you try to decide the best way to go about loving others. Only he knows the future, and he explains a lot about the overall plan in the Bible.\nSome good places to start if you want to study the source of our theory and the source of real wealth, are the 6th chapter of Matthew (2nd half mostly) and the 4th and 5th chapters of James (first couple verses of each especially). We have a lot of other study material too if you are interested.\nTHE COST It\u0026rsquo;s not realistic to expect that the rest of the world will quickly accept our new economic policy. People have been conditioned against it for too long.\nTo really change the world, you have to change the hearts of people, and that\u0026rsquo;s a very tall order. But never underestimate the power of one life. People like Gandhi, Socrates, and Jesus Christ have had a mighty influence on history because they believed some things were more important than even life itself.\nJust one such individual in the world today could make a big difference; and two or three\u0026hellip; or even a dozen might be enough to start a spiritual revolution that could change the entire world.\nThere have been armies of people who were willing to kill for what they believed in. Why not an army of people who are willing to die for what they believe in?\nWe can give our lives by dying quickly for this new world order, or we can give our lives a day at a time by labouring patiently and faithfully to bring a little light to a dark world.\nRemember that if you change even one small part of the world, you have still changed the world. Much change is very slow and gradual.\nWe have learned that the message we preach often causes people to act in irrational anger. Sometimes they themselves do not know why they are reacting in the way they are. But if we are sure that our motives have only been to show love, then even a hateful response should be encouraging; it proves that we are getting through.\nWhen they have done all they can to stop us, and we still continue to love, they will know then that love is stronger than hate.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/no-pain-no-gain/","title":"No Pain No Gain","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/NoPainNo_hu_66f2b78bfc769726.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"630\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/NoPainNo_hu_9552dc36fc561431.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/NoPainNo_hu_2d94fb40250a82c.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/NoPainNo_hu_fcb8d091595b8510.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Top Forty","tags":"Positive","content":"In the early years of our community, we all actively participated in fun runs. The more serious runners would often say, \u0026ldquo;No pain, no gain.\u0026rdquo; I was sometimes amazed at the amount of discipline some athletes exercised in order to excel in their sport. Hours of every day would be taken up with developing physical fitness, speed, and endurance. To excel, they had to learn to push through what was called \u0026ldquo;the pain barrier\u0026rdquo;. But when they succeeded, they would come out on the other side as winners.\nWe noticed, though, that sport is one of the few remaining areas of life in Western society where physical discipline is encouraged. We live in a generation of quick, easy fixes. Drugs of one form or another are expected to solve all of our physical (and for some, even our spiritual and emotional) problems. The drugs range from legitimate prescription drugs and alcohol, to dangerous and illegal drugs.\nIn the midst of all this, we seem to have forgotten that suffering is an inescapable part of life in the real world. Many of us continue to search for a world where there will be no pain, no suffering, and no death. We run away from and rebel against anything that seeks to bring us back to this reality.\nUnfortunately, most of us feel happiness means being free from pain and suffering. We assume that happiness and pain are opposites, and this is a very wrong assumption. Happiness is elusive because it cannot be achieved as an end in itself. It\u0026rsquo;s a by-product of a well-lived life. And suffering is part of any well-lived life. So when we seek to avoid all pain (whether it be physical, mental, or spiritual), we actually cheat ourselves out of true happiness.\nUntil recent times, Christians accepted that suffering would be a necessary part of their lives. (2 Timothy 2:12, and 1 Peter 1:6-7) This attitude helped them to work through their pain and suffering. It purified them, making them stronger, more compassionate, and more useable for God.\nLearning to suffer starts at birth (the baby\u0026rsquo;s first test of endurance), and it should continue throughout life. Everyone must learn to cope with little pains in positive ways when they are young, so that they can manage greater sufferings later in life. Parents who overly protect their children hinder their children\u0026rsquo;s maturation process. We all need to learn how to deal with pain in order to become adults. We need to make mistakes, and learn from them, in order to become stronger and wiser. Avoiding mistakes and the pains associated with them (by withdrawing from the battle) keeps us forever immature.\nWhen some of us long-standing community members get together, we occasionally reminisce about our times together in the past. It is interesting to note that we rarely discuss our trips to Disneyland or our dinner parties with ambassadors and other celebrities. What we most talk about, instead, are the hard times that we have gone through; and we do so with much enthusiasm and with fond memories. The hard times, the dangerous times, and the painful times, have given us our greatest spiritual treasures. They have drawn us close together, and they have helped us become who we are today.\nFinding meaning from suffering requires effort, and a certain amount of mental discipline. As we move from a \u0026ldquo;Why me?\u0026rdquo; attitude to a \u0026ldquo;What can I learn from this?\u0026rdquo; attitude, God will meet us with his grace, giving us hope and strength. As long as we keep trying, God (and often other people) will continue to help us. It\u0026rsquo;s only when we give up trying that there is no hope. For no one, not even God can do it for us. God will not overrule our will. It\u0026rsquo;s up to us to keep trying, and when we do, we\u0026rsquo;ll find God gets beneath our heavy burden and lifts it along with us.\nThe Bible says that even Jesus learned obedience through the things that he suffered. (Hebrews 5:8) The next time we encounter something that gives us pain, we need to remember that it, too, is a part of God\u0026rsquo;s will for us. However painful it may be, it\u0026rsquo;s part of God\u0026rsquo;s refining process, to make us come through like gold. No pain, no gain!\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/prayer-meetings/","title":"Prayer Meetings","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/quak/PrayerMeetings_hu_28f59e887c2f0f67.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/quak\\/PrayerMeetings_hu_cd1083856678298e.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/quak/PrayerMeetings_hu_8e9ea0d5794f524b.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/quak\\/PrayerMeetings_hu_dab49f5037e215a8.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Quaker Similarities","tags":"Prayer","content":"(This is a Bible study, so you will need to look up the references in parentheses if you want to get the full meaning of this article.)\nWe Jesus Christians do not have prayer meetings where people pray out loud and other people listen. Jesus told us not to do this (Matthew 6:5-6). But we do believe in praying. Sometimes it is good to pray with other Christians (Acts 21:5-6). When we pray together, God likes this (Matthew 18:19-20). We can do this in several different ways without disobeying Jesus. We can pray together by saying or singing a special prayer in unison. We Jesus Christians often do this before a meal. Some churches do it by saying the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer together.\nWe can also pray together in a meeting where everyone prays in their own words at the same time. It is not easy to do this, because some people may not pray and they will listen to the people who do pray. This is why this kind of prayer meeting should not happen in a public meeting (1 Corinthians 14:23). We have found that this kind of meeting is most effective when there is a crisis and people are praying more or less \u0026ldquo;in desperation\u0026rdquo;.\nIn a prayer meeting where we are asking for something from God, what we say in the prayer itself may not be as important as agreeing on what it is that we all want (Acts 2:1). What we call discussion prayers can do that. They may sound more like a business meeting than a prayer meeting. If someone wants to ask God for something, he or she can tell the rest of the group about it. People in the group say if they want the same thing. They talk about how much they want the same thing, and whether or not there is something that they would want more. The prayer may be changed several times before there is full agreement.\nSuch discussion helps us to pray more wisely (James 4:3). It is important in a meeting like this for each member to be honest about how much they want something. It is not good to ask for something from God if you do not want it with your whole heart. (James 5:16)\nWe have found from prayer meetings like this, that in the end, the prayer is almost always the same. What we discover that we want more than anything is pretty well summed up in the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Prayer. We want God\u0026rsquo;s will. We want more love for others. We want forgiveness for ourselves. We want to be protected from evil. We want God to know how much we love him. We want God\u0026rsquo;s provision for his people everywhere. And we want the whole world to honour and serve God too.\nBy far, our most common prayer meetings have been \u0026ldquo;listening times\u0026rdquo;. These are times when we do not ask God for anything except for him to tell us what his will is for us (Matthew 6:10).\nFirst, we explain to any visitors or new members what it is that we are going to do. Then we all sit quietly and wait for God to speak to us individually. During the period when we are waiting, we try to stop thinking about anything. We should not do this for anyone except God. If we do it for God, he will not let an evil spirit come into our mind while our mind is blank. Only his Spirit will speak to us (Luke 11:9-13).\nWe should ask God to speak to us like this when we go to sleep at night too. He can protect us from bad dreams (Isaiah 26:3).\nWhen you are listening for God to speak, you should pay special attention to anything he puts into your mind. Sometimes he will say something that you do not want to hear. Sometimes he will use pictures to speak to you, like happens with a dream. (See also Dreams.)\nIf you do not understand what he is saying, you will be less likely to fight against it in your mind. That is one reason why the message is often hidden in symbols to begin with Then, later, when you think about it and when you share it with others in the meeting, you may come to understand more fully what it was that he was trying to say. Sometimes you will have only part of the answer to what he is trying to say, and another person in the meeting will have the rest of it. That way, God works through more than one person at a time, teaching us to listen as a group as well as listening as individuals.\nDuring a listening time, after the short period of silence, you will be asked if you received any sort of a message. Even if you do not understand what you received, you should share it with the others. Together we can work at understanding what God is saying.\nGod can, at times, tell us something really powerful and life-changing, but most of the lessons that we receive in listening times are just bits of advice and encouragement for that particular day. When God tells us something, no matter how small, it is for a reason. He expects us to alter the choices that we make because of the directions that he gives to us in listening times. Do not listen to God and then go straight out and forget what it was that he said (Romans 2:13).\nYou can listen to God at any time. You do not need a formal prayer meeting before you can do this. You can listen to God by yourself or with someone else. Every day you should have a \u0026ldquo;quiet time\u0026rdquo;. Be ready to receive anything that God wants to tell you at all times (1 Thessalonians 5:17).\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/prevericating/","title":"Prevericating","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/AvoidingTruth_hu_e350c480474b4c73.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/AvoidingTruth_hu_1b7924bb02213e89.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/AvoidingTruth_hu_27ce9f61702df7b5.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/AvoidingTruth_hu_9475d505df18e85d.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Strong Meat","tags":"Hard Truth","content":"Prevaricating is defined as: \u0026ldquo;speaking evasively; equivocating\u0026rdquo;. And equivocating is defined as: \u0026ldquo;using vague or intentionally evasive language\u0026rdquo;. Whichever term you choose to use for it, there is a lot of this that goes on in the world today, and it happens far too often in our community as well.\nI have wrestled with this for much of my life\u0026hellip; first in myself, and then in a lot of other people. And I feel that if we could, within our community, make some serious breakthroughs in this area, it would be a major turning point in our history. I really am hopeful that we may be getting close to that point.\nThe fact that people prevaricate or equivocate when asked questions that threaten to show them up in a bad light hardly needs to be mentioned. We have each seen it in others when they have been out of the spirit. However, I think that there is something in many of us that starts to sympathise with the person who is prevaricating. We\u0026rsquo;ve been there before and we know how it feels, so we want to get the other person off the hook as quickly as possible, and we are ready to accept any shortcut that will achieve that.\nSuch an attitude plays right into the prevaricator\u0026rsquo;s hands. They simply say something that sounds like a good explanation or a half-way decent apology, and we take the part that suits us and choose to ignore the possibility that what they said had two meanings. As I have already said, we do it because we are sympathising with the person. And this is where prevaricating can spread in a close-knit community like ours, like a disease. Until it is rooted out of your own life, you will continue to ignore and even defend it in the lives of others. In fact, you would be a hypocrite if you did not.\nSo obviously, we need to recognise our own tendency to prevaricate. I think it helps if we understand, first, that this IS a widespread problem. You are not alone. Let\u0026rsquo;s turn this silent conspiracy between all of the prevaricators, into more of a Prevaricators Anonymous approach, where we all consciously choose to help one another overcome the problem.\nPersonally, I think that our focus needs to be on the starting point, that moment when someone says something (usually asking a question) that makes you feel that a fault is about to be exposed. There is in most of us a slight increase in our heartbeat when that happens. That is the sort of thing that lie detectors pick up. In lie detector tests they ask simple yes or no questions mostly, and they don\u0026rsquo;t determine the lie by what you say; they determine it by measuring bodily changes\u0026hellip; heartbeat, in particular. And so that is what you need to look for to spot the problem in yourself. Listen to your body. Prevaricators rarely tell outright lies, but the heartbeat thing still happens.\nI will give an example. Someone says, \u0026ldquo;How many contacts did you follow up this month?\u0026rdquo; In the split second after the question is asked, you realise several things. You realise that you have only followed up two or three contacts. You realise that you were supposed to have followed up 24. You realise that the person asking the question is not likely to check any further for proof, and so this is a situation where you could quite possibly get away with a lie. And you realise that you don\u0026rsquo;t really want to be guilty of an outright lie. All of these thoughts flying through your head at lightning speed cause your pulse to increase. That is what you need to look for if you want to track the problem down to its source. In a very short time you will be able to convince yourself that you did NOT go through all those different options (and the ones that follow) in order to hide the truth. But if you can spot the nervous reaction to the question, maybe you will be able to see that the increase in your heartbeat came because of those reasons.\nIn the next split second, after you have established that there is something you are ashamed of and that you may be able to hide it, you consider a list of possible answers. Obviously, you could come right out and tell the truth in the clearest possible terms, but that is the least popular option and the one you are least likely to take. You could tell an outright lie and say that you did 24 follow-ups (or more). But telling lies isn\u0026rsquo;t a Christian thing to do. So you settle for something in between. It could be, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m afraid that I didn\u0026rsquo;t do as many as I should have.\u0026rdquo; And if that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, and you are asked to be more specific, you say, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know off-hand. I would have to check my records.\u0026rdquo; If you are pushed farther, you could say, \u0026ldquo;It was definitely under the quota; I know that, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure by how much.\u0026rdquo; There is a kind of haggle, where you could keep changing what you have said to be closer to the truth (\u0026ldquo;I would say that I did less than half of what I should have done.\u0026rdquo;), hoping that at some point, your interrogator will accept your vague answer and let you off the hook.\nHowever, in all of this equivocating, something else is happening in your spirit as well. You are developing a whole new explanation for what is going on, and it isn\u0026rsquo;t very nice. You start to tell yourself that you are being attacked, assaulted, and abused. The person questioning you is being an aggressor and you are his or her innocent victim. Well, not entirely innocent, because you did fail to make your quota, but innocent in that you did not lie. You said right at the start that you did not make the quota, and they just would not acept that or let up. By focussing on this during the exchange, which more than likely gets more heated as it goes on, you will eventually be able to say to the person questioning you that you have become unable to think clearly under all of the questioning that is going on. You need time to think\u0026hellip; time away from all of this pressure. And even if you get time away, you will be able to retain the impression that the major problem was not that you were hiding the truth, because, after all, you did give at least some of the truth. Instead, you will retain the impression that the major problem was one of confusion and a frightful misunderstanding. Whether the confusion was caused by your interrogator or just by your inability to cope with the interrogation, the main thing, in your mind, will be that there was \u0026lsquo;confusion\u0026rsquo;. And you will be able to overlook the fact that you were the one who deliberately created the confusion in the first place.\nSoon you will see your biggest spiritual problem as being the need to forgive the impatience of the interrogator. You may even be able to apologise for that. But the root problem would not have been solved. Even if the interrogator should persevere to the point where it is established that you only did two or three contact follow-ups last month\u0026hellip; well, actually two\u0026hellip; there will have been so much dramatics in getting there that you (and anyone else who is witness to it all) will feel that far too much fuss has been made over something that you admitted to in the first place. Certainly it is your Christian duty to forgive and overlook all that fuss, but in the back of your mind, you see that what is really causing problems in this community is so much interrogation, and you tell yourself that if you were ever the leader, you would not do that. You would trust people more and not antagonise them with so many questions. And given the chance, you would vote for a leader who does the same thing.\nCan you see how diabolically deceptive this approach is? It makes strict honesty and accountability redundant, and replaces it with an easy-going lack of accountability that is eventually going to lead to no community at all. We saw it with the rebels. They were going to go and show us how it is done. No amount of warning from us could stop them from believing that a world of unaccountability would actually work. And yet they fell apart almost as soon as they walked out the door.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve seen it in people who have stepped out on their own and tried to start their own communities without the kind of honesty and accountability that we require and they too have not been able to grow.\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;ve seen it in leaders within the community who just wanted to be nice guys (or gals). They became the tools through which prevarication has flourished. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll cover for you if you\u0026rsquo;ll cover for me,\u0026rdquo; is the bottom line in this kind of leadership. It\u0026rsquo;s an idyllic relationship for a while. Both sides are happy. But when examined closely, there is a lot of evidence that everything is running downhill, drawing only on the energy that was built up through years of accountability.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s work together to overcome this problem. Let\u0026rsquo;s work on examining our own spirit and being brutally honest with ourselves. And let\u0026rsquo;s stop blaming leaders for the confusion that our prevarications have caused.\nNow, having said that, I also want to emphasise how important it is for leaders to be patient and loving in our attempts to arrive at the truth. Because I am the one who most often acts in this capacity, what I am writing here is basically for me. But obviously I am hoping that others of you will start being leaders in this area as well, and so when you\u0026rsquo;ve made some progress in overcoming your own prevarication, then perhaps you can move on to this section for some further tips in dealing with prevarication in others.\nThe first thing I want to say is that I love you guys. Well, no, the first thing I want to say is that GOD loves you guys. So even when I am frustrated and angry about something you\u0026rsquo;ve done (or more likely, just over the prevarication itself), the truth is that God loves you and is willing to forgive you for whatever, if you will just admit it and ask him for forgiveness. It is a direct consequence of our feeling that we will not be forgiven that we go to such ridiculous extremes to make ourselves look good in the eyes of others.\nI hope that people can believe (on the basis of my actions in other areas, if not on the basis of what happens when you are being questioned about something) that I too love you. If you can hold onto that, it may help with regard to the awful feeling that I know you get when the interrogation heats up. I am genuinely and deeply sorry that I have not communicated more effectively and more consistently my desire to help you and not hurt you in your spiritual walk.\nOne of the ways that I can do this is by dealing with individuals privately. I am trying to do this more. But I have a dilemma here in two ways. One is that prevarications often come up spontaneously in the midst of otherwise casual discussion, and they seem to happen most when there are other witnesses (because so much of the motivation for prevarication is to avoid looking bad in the eyes of others); and the other dilemma is that deception comes in so quickly that it often becomes impossible to get a person to remember what was actually said if I wait until later when I can be alone with you and talk about what was happening.\nWhen I have tried to do this in the past, the problem has generally not been resolved at the first or second stage anyway. There is something about prevarication (in particular, the process I mentioned above, where a person gets themselves worked up into a frantic emotional state about being attacked and \u0026lsquo;confused\u0026rsquo;) that seems to create a permanent blind spot in a person\u0026rsquo;s mind. If it is not dealt with on the spot, it will probably never be resolved.\nWhat I probably need to learn to do most is to be more quietly spoken when questioning people about a vague answer. The trick seems to be to slow things right down. Unfortunately, when someone is feeling panic, they often speak quickly and at great length (because much of what they are trying to do is to turn things around from what information is actually being sought to something else that will serve to confuse the issues more.) Acting too quickly on my part will antagonise the prevaricator, but acting too slowly results in everyone in the room becoming confused, and often forgetting what was said or asked in the first place.\nI am also hoping to be able to include more assurances that I am not wanting to hurt people when I ask further questions.\nRemember, however, that it is not instantly clear to me that someone is prevaricating either. Sometimes there are genuine misunderstandings that can be easily cleared up. But if I sense that you are getting rattled, then I start to think that you are hiding something. And if you sense that I am getting rattled, then you start to feel \u0026ldquo;attacked\u0026rdquo;. In other words, the vicious cycle can be triggered by either of us, and it\u0026rsquo;s not always easy to work out who started it. As a general rule, however, I think that I (or some other leader) must take the blame for heated exchanges that have come from genuine misunderstandings.\nAnd even when you are the one who started it (i.e. because you are hiding some fault on your part), I believe that there is much more that I can do to remove the \u0026ldquo;heat\u0026rdquo; from the overall process. If we can start by getting the feeling that we are working together on a problem that requires effort from all/both of us, that may be more effective.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t say too much more here, because what is really needed is more practice on my part. It\u0026rsquo;s very hard to \u0026ldquo;teach\u0026rdquo; something publicly to myself. Suffice it to say that I WANT to be more loving and patient in my dealings with prevaricating within our ranks. I think that when we get the idea that we are all working on our spiritual weaknesses together, and when we can all own up to our faults (whether it be prevaricating or being too impatient with prevaricating) then we will find a much more powerful sense of love and unity than what we have at the moment.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/reality-in-utopia/","title":"Reality in Utopia","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/lefto/Mistake_hu_c5337e0dc5880c0e.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/lefto\\/Mistake_hu_68cfe8c41080b777.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/lefto/Mistake_hu_ce61852ba85bbcae.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/lefto\\/Mistake_hu_d7234c33fce9f1bc.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Leftovers","tags":"Practical, Community","content":"Utopia is an ideal world that does not exist. People searching for such a place often abandon ideals altogether when they fail to find it.\nAs Christians, we believe Utopia does exist, but only as the kingdom of heaven. This is a paradox, because the kingdom of heaven is invisible. It is always just beyond our physical grasp. Like a butterfly it flits away whenever we get close to it. But it does exist, and it is real. We must not stop believing this. Like the butterfly, however, our best bet is to concentrate on seeing the kingdom of heaven rather than trying to contain it. Keep the \u0026lsquo;vision\u0026rsquo; of such a world, but be prepared for problems each time you try to package it.\nThe Old Testament message was given to the kingdom of Israel. The New Testament message is given to individuals. The kingdom of heaven and the Kingdom of Israel are very different. Israel was a visible nation, race, and religion. The kingdom of heaven is an invisible nation, race, and religion.\nThe Kingdom of Israel wasn\u0026rsquo;t evil, but it did illustrate the human predicament with regard to spiritual perfection. What God had intended to be used as a tool (i.e. Israel\u0026rsquo;s rules and government) became an end in itself. Whenever something like that happens, God usually has to toss the tool out and look for something to take its place.\nWe would like our fellowship to work as a tool\u0026hellip; a tool that can help each of us to move closer to spiritual perfection. But we are not utopia. We are not the kingdom of heaven.\nYet we can be used by God to move people closer to the real utopia. If you focus on our imperfections, you could toss us aside, as a false utopia, a big disappointment.\nBut before you do, ask yourself: Where is the real utopia? Is it back in what you came from? Is it to be found off on your own in the bush? Bits of the kingdom of heaven can be found anywhere. But only as long as you are walking in all the light that you have.\nAnd where do you see the light shining most brightly today? That\u0026rsquo;s where you need to be if you are not to lose sight of the \u0026lsquo;butterfly\u0026rsquo;. Aim at perfection. Do whatever it takes to get closer to the ideals of the kingdom of heaven. But don\u0026rsquo;t give up when reality falls short of your expectations.\nNobody\u0026rsquo;s perfect. I get discouraged when I cannot get through to you. But no doubt you get equally discouraged when you see how impatient I can be. These disappointments seem to be part of the game. The kingdom of heaven is a journey as much as a destination. The kingdom of heaven is aiming at perfection; it is faithfulness in spite of our failings.\nWe each dream of a place where others perform to our satisfaction. But to be utopia, we would need to perform to their satisfaction too.\nThe best I can see happening in this world is a fellowship where each of us tries to serve the others, not expecting anything in return. If we all did this, things would work out fine. But even that I have never seen work perfectly for many people for very long. It\u0026rsquo;s not just that others let me down either; for I too have let them down.\nPerhaps that is why the symbol of the kingdom of heaven is a cross. The Garden of Eden flopped. But God sacrificed his Son to illustrate something more beautiful than all the flowers and trees in the Garden.\nAnd that is God\u0026rsquo;s real Utopia, the invisible kingdom of heaven.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/slaves-of-the-antichrist/","title":"Servants of The Antichrist","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/antichrist1_hu_2e957ffd7f1667b3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"420\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/antichrist1_hu_cec5feeea469c464.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/antichrist1_hu_1924578f4fb67898.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/antichrist1_hu_d7dcc3b843a6a7a8.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Endtime and Sex Issues","tags":"Prophesy","content":"The Left Behind series is inspiring, in that it makes people think about serious, life-and-death situations. Yet it tends to assume that, even in the face of disaster, life for fundamentalist American Christians will center around the same values and goals that have dominated their lives up until now. In other words, people will still go to church on Sundays and work in system jobs the rest of the week, right through the Tribulation and all that comes with it. They will still be loaded with money, and they will still jet around the world at will. There is nothing in the book that speaks to the condition of poor Christians. This materialistic philosophy is practised at a time (in the story) when people should be seriously considering whether the values they lived by before the trouble began were really the right ones.\nIn desperate circumstances, people often see the futility of so much that they did before disaster struck. But the Left Behind series fails to suggest that there may be anything wrong with the materialism of evangelical fundamentalism. Even in the face of a choice between serving Jesus or serving the Antichrist, the book\u0026rsquo;s two heroes both find themselves very much in the employ of the Antichrist. There is reflected in them the same double-mindedness that so many Christians evidence when it comes to trying to work for God and work for money at the same time. They are forced to admit that they work for money because they fear being without it, and they justify being in their jobs, on the grounds that they may one day be a \u0026ldquo;witness\u0026rdquo; where they are.\nIn war type movies, where people are displaced and fighting for their lives, talk of paid employment becomes fairly meaningless. Yet, the first six books in the Left Behind series suggest that paid employment is the norm for Christians during the time of great trouble. Not only are the heroes expected to keep working for money, but they are seen as getting the best jobs with the highest salaries. Against all reason, they are seen as being divinely protected in their work for the Antichrist, who, for no clear reason, keeps them on his staff even when he knows they are supposed to be representing his arch enemy, Jesus.\nWhile Rayford Steele and Buck Cameron (the heroes of the Left Behind series) continue to serve the Antichrist, they gain nothing from it that affects their ability to serve Jesus. Because they fear opposition if they speak out for their faith, their on-the-job \u0026ldquo;witness\u0026rdquo; is also ineffective. They appear to be there for one reason, and that is for the money that it brings in. The book itself is fairly clear about that (see below).\nGod could call someone to infiltrate the enemy\u0026rsquo;s camp for a specific purpose. But that is not so with Buck and Rayford. Year after year they do and say nothing of any spiritual significance. Consequently, they are tormented by guilt, which they (or their authors) brush aside with faint hints that they have no other choice.\nThe first chapter of Soul Harvest (volume 4) is amazingly honest in depicting Rayford\u0026rsquo;s double-mindedness with regard to his service to the Antichrist. Because he is the series hero, his eventual caving in to fear and selfishness tends to justify similar gutlessness on the part of other Christians, both now and presumably in the future, when the real Tribulation begins.\nSoul Harvest starts with these words: \u0026ldquo;Rayford Steele wore the uniform of the enemy of his soul, and he hated himself for it.\u0026rdquo; Rayford rips the coat off and beats it on the ground, in anger that the Antichrist has just destroyed thousands of lives in a needless war.\nA strange sentence appears on the next page: \u0026ldquo;Rayford considered abandoning all vestiges of his connection to Nicolae Carpathia\u0026rsquo;s (the Antichrist\u0026rsquo;s) regime, but his attention was drawn again to the luxuriously appointed arm patches.\u0026rdquo; Why should luxurious arm patches cause him to change his mind?\nA second explanation is given for Rayford\u0026rsquo;s change of mind: \u0026ldquo;As he knelt to retrieve his coat, Rayford\u0026rsquo;s maddening logic returned\u0026ndash;the practicality that made him who he was. Having no idea what he might find in the ruins of his condominium, he couldn\u0026rsquo;t treat as dispensable what might constitute his only remaining set of clothes.\u0026rdquo;\nSo, whether Rayford decides to continue serving the enemy of his soul because he needs the clothes or because he craves the luxuries and power that go with them, he never really considers the possibility of trusting God to provide his material needs. Nor does he face the possibility of God asking him to live without luxuriously appointed arm patches.\nOn pages three and four Rayford threatens to tell the Antichrist what he thinks of him; but when faced with the opportunity to do so, he caves in again. Here is the phone dialogue just before he is connected to the Antichrist. Rayfor says:\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t put Carpathia on or I swear I\u0026rsquo;ll\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Stand by for the Potentate.\u0026rdquo;\nRayford switched the phone to his right hand, ready to smash it on the ground, but he restrained himself. When avenues of communication reopened, he wanted to be able to check on his loved ones.\nFirst it is clothing, and then it is loved ones. In both situations, the Antichrist has him in his grip, because Rayford, like so many others, has never considered obeying Jesus when he said to put him before loved ones, before clothing, and even before food.\nFood also gets a mention, on page 62 of the same volume. Rayford is feasting at a sumptuous buffet held in the Antichrist\u0026rsquo;s private hideout while the rest of the world is being decimated. Referring to his faith, Rayford says to Mac, \u0026ldquo;Carpathia knows where I stand.\u0026rdquo; Mac replies, \u0026ldquo;He likes you. Maybe he feels secure knowing you don\u0026rsquo;t hide anything from him.\u0026rdquo;\nNext paragraph: \u0026ldquo;It might be the enemy\u0026rsquo;s food, [Rayford] thought, but it does the job.\u0026rdquo; The italics are not mine. The authors obviously do not want readers to miss the point. The \u0026ldquo;job\u0026rdquo; is his need for food. Compromise with the enemy had met that need. It did the job.\nHis decision to join the Antichrist in the shelter was made with full knowledge that Rayford was turning his back on the suffering that was taking place outside. The closing words of the first chapter of Soul Harvest state: \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;d seen awful things in his life, but the carnage at this airport was going to top them all. A shelter, even the Antichrist\u0026rsquo;s, sounded better than this.\u0026rdquo;\nIn his \u0026ldquo;heart\u0026rdquo;, of course, Rayford is always convinced that his true loyalty is to Jesus. But in his actions, everything he does is a total contradiction. His guilt leads him to experience so much hatred for the Antichrist that he personally plots to kill Carpathia. Powerless to wage a proper spiritual battle for truth, Rayford Steele contents himself with fighting a useless battle with a carnal weapon.\nIf we study the behaviour of the hero, to find the underlying lesson in the Left Behind series, we learn that Christians can (and probably should) serve the Antichrist in order to save themselves and their loved ones, and in order to live a more comfortable life in this evil world. As long as they profess loyalty to Jesus with their lips (out of earshot of the AC of course), it matters little what their actions say.\nThe enemy of our soul wants us to praise him too, and so the series is loaded with titles that the Antichrist and his cohorts give themselves, each one more pompous than the one before. This too angers Rayford, but he continues to do whatever it takes to keep his job.\nThe nearest thing to insubordination is when he refuses to return to base immediately, because he is looking for his wife amongst the ruins. The Antichrist says he will overlook such behaviour; but he notes that Rayford has not used the term Potentate (most powerful one) when referring to his leader. Carpathia says: \u0026ldquo;Now is no time to neglect protocol, Captain Steele. A pardoned subordinate is behooved to address his superior\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nRayford shoots back, \u0026ldquo;All right Potentate Carpathia\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; (Again, the emphasis is not mine.)\nOn page 142, Rayford objects to calling Carpathia His Excellency. \u0026ldquo;You are using a title that has for generations been limited to religious leaders and royalty,\u0026rdquo; he says to an A.C. assistant.\nBut in the end Rayford uses that title as well. (e.g. page 423: \u0026ldquo;Your Excellency,\u0026rdquo; he said, swallowing any vestige of pride, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m assuming you\u0026rsquo;ll need Mac and me to get you to Israel tomorrow.\u0026rdquo;)\nRayford and his co-pilot discuss the expediency of sharing their faith on their job, and they decide that they should not, despite an earlier statement that Christians must be prepared to confess their faith publicly to be saved. (Romans 10:9-10) \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re supposed to tell lots of people,\u0026rdquo; Rayford had said. (page 133) But he admits that the other hero, Buck Cameron, kept his faith secret outside of church meetings. \u0026ldquo;He thought it best to keep that to himself, so he could be more effective,\u0026rdquo; Rayford explained. He suggests that Mac do the same. (page 183) Mac asks, \u0026ldquo;What about that verse about confessing with your mouth?\u0026rdquo; Rayford replies, \u0026ldquo;I have no idea. Do the rules still stand at a time like this? Are you supposed to confess your faith to the Antichrist? I just don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter a particularly sinister speech from the Antichrist, Rayford and Mac\u0026rsquo;s fellow employees are drawn to almost worship him. This is recorded on page 214: \u0026ldquo;When the Global Community employees in the mess hall leaped to their feet, cheering and clapping, Rayford and Mac stood, only to keep from appearing conspicuous. Mac\u0026rsquo;s attention was drawn to someone else who was slow to stand; it is a clue that the other employee must also be a secret believer.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat would Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego have thought of such faith? If they had merely gone through the motions (somewhat hesitantly) when ordered to bow down to the image of the Antichrist in their day, they could have escaped the fiery furnace. (Daniel 3:10-18) But what kind of a witness would it have been?\nThe kind of faith that Rayford Wetnoodle practises is the kind of faith Satan would like to see more of in the church. The Left Behind books are just another part of Satan\u0026rsquo;s worldwide deception, teaching even supposedly staunch fundamentalists that compromise is OK in any situation where it may cost you something to obey God.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/sexs-sense/","title":"Sex Sense","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/SexSense_hu_b3129a33f7b89070.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"747\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/SexSense_hu_c044a2c307dc9586.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/SexSense_hu_10b2b346db3d164d.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/SexSense_hu_cf51835d38a8b6d0.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Endtime and Sex Issues","tags":"Sex","content":"Opinions, experiences, customs, and beliefs about sex differ so much that almost nothing can be said dogmatically on the subject. Yet this is an area where dogmas abound\u0026hellip; from restrictive religious dogmas to permissive liberal dogmas (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Nothing is wrong if it makes you feel good\u0026rdquo;).\nEven individuals fluctuate with regard to what we feel right about. We look back with embarrassment at things we did when extremely aroused; yet we know that under similar conditions we will probably do it all again.\nNevertheless, we will share here some observations that may help to bridge the gap between these two extreme approaches to sexual matters:\n1. Times have changed. Morality should not be affected by changing fashion; but much that passes for morality is, itself, just tradition. Those who say people were just as promiscuous during the Victorian era (albeit secretly) are as wrong as those who argue that people can be as sexually restrained today as they were in the 19th Century.\nThe two big changes are in birth control and the mass media. These two factors work together to promote greater sexual activity: The media gives non-stop stimulation; while birth control removes the threat of unwanted pregnancy. Rejecting birth control without rejecting the mass media has put impossible demands on millions of people.\nSex is used in advertising, music, movies, TV, and novels. If we could escape direct contact with all of these, we still could not escape the influence of a society that also has been indoctrinated by the media. When everyone we meet assumes that sexual promiscuity is the norm, it is difficult to maintain a conviction and life-style that differs from this. Sexual performance is so much a part of Western values that even the wives of church leaders compete for the attention of the opposite sex through clothing, makeup, jewellery, etc. (contrary to 1 Peter 3:3-4).\nOne could go crazy trying to turn away from all such temptations. Or one could recognise birth control as part of God\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;way of escape\u0026rsquo;. (1 Corinthians 10:13) In other words, in a situation (i.e. marriage) where a little sexual activity is not regarded as sinful (Hebrews 13:4), then a lot of sexual activity should not be regarded as sinful either. One way or the other, there is going to be more sexual activity as a result of all the sexual stimulation coming at us from every direction these days. And all that is necessary for couples to be able to engage in sex more freely, is for them to use birth control. (The problems faced by singles is addressed in the next point.)\n2. Curiosity and arousal are not lust. It is almost impossible to stop one\u0026rsquo;s biological urges; but it is not all that difficult to control one\u0026rsquo;s commitment to chastity. A misunderstanding of Christ\u0026rsquo;s reference to adultery in one\u0026rsquo;s heart (Matthew 5:27-28) has led many people into a lifetime of guilt feelings about being interested in or aroused by thoughts about sex. Add to this the suggestion that even within marriage it is sinful to want sex for pleasure (while at the same time seeking to avoid pregnancy) and you have a society of people who are preaching something that very few of them can practice.\nRarely do the strictest puritans condemn wet dreams; yet many are quick to condemn wet daydreams (i.e. masturbation) as being lustful and spiritually adulterous. But masturbation and/or frequent intercourse in marriage are often the best ways to avoid committing adultery; i.e. by dealing with arousal in such a way as to remove the biological pressure to commit adultery.\nJesus was not condemning the Pharisees for being sexually aroused when he said they were guilty of committing adultery in their hearts; instead, he knew they wanted to be unfaithful to their wives, but restrained themselves only out of fear of being caught.\nCondemning birth control and masturbation (two areas where the Bible is notably silent) creates unfair guilt feelings in people who are being constantly pushed by the media into some form of sexual relief. This unnatural form of condemnation has actually fostered homosexuality, prostitution, and infidelity (subjects on which the Bible is not silent!)\nIf you are sexually frustrated, but do not want to commit adultery, then masturbation or increased marital sex are the obvious solutions. Of course, if you want to commit adultery, then whether or not you ever get up enough courage to do it, you are still guilty of lusting after something you should not have. That is the point Jesus was making in Matthew 5:27-28.\n3. There is a place for double standards. The way a couple behaves in the bedroom is obviously not the way they behave in public. Blatant sexuality, as stated earlier, is a source of constant sexual frustration for others. So a married couple should be considerate of the effect their actions will have on others before they flaunt their liberties. What is taken for granted by one person may be extremely embarrassing to others; we need to respect the feelings of others.\nMuch of the adventure in marriage comes from sexual exploration and discovery. While young people need to feel free about discussing sex issues, the ideal place for them to find the answers to much that is only idle curiosity is in the company of the one they marry. It is a shame that the media has robbed young people of many of the joys of such discovery.\n4. Finally, the real problem (once again) is GREED. The church has, for too long, laid the blame for sexual immorality on the backs of the sexually active masses, with only rare swipes at the merchants who have exploited sex to sell their products. Until and unless the real culprits are exposed, the confusion and the false condemnation will continue.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/signs-of-the-times/","title":"Signs of The Times","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/SignOfTimes_hu_1df191b13f9c87f1.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"525\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/SignOfTimes_hu_bf2de639cf2c1d32.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/SignOfTimes_hu_ed9a6e9e125797f5.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/SignOfTimes_hu_4d0109a389fd65d0.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Endtime and Sex Issues","tags":"Prophesy","content":"War and Peace\nWars are the most common proof given that the end of the world is near. Yet they are mentioned specifically by Christ as proof that the end has not come: \u0026ldquo;You will hear of wars and rumours of wars. Do not let this trouble you, for all these things must happen, but the end is not yet.\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 24:6)\nAn increase in the number, intensity, and \u0026lsquo;rumours\u0026rsquo; (media coverage) of wars does, however, lead to an international craving for a single world government to end all wars. Jesus calls an increase of wars and natural disasters the \u0026lsquo;beginning of sorrows\u0026rsquo;. (Matthew 24:8)\nThe world government that arises in response to all these disasters will be a truer sign that the end is near. Its trademark will be a false \u0026lsquo;peace\u0026rsquo;, or time of worldwide prosperity. The Hebrew prophet Daniel says of the final world ruler, \u0026ldquo;He will come in peacefully, and obtain power through flattery.\u0026rdquo; (Daniel 11:21) \u0026ldquo;And through peace (or prosperity) he will destroy many.\u0026rdquo; (Daniel 8:25)\nQuakes, Famines, \u0026amp; Plagues\nAnother part of the \u0026lsquo;beginning of sorrows\u0026rsquo; will be natural disasters. Two of these (earthquakes and famines) have dramatically increased in this century, though an even more dramatic increase may be yet to come. The third disaster (plagues) may be just beginning, and AIDS may be only a part of it.\nThese disasters are likely to lead to a call for a global organisation to combat them.\nDenominationalism\nA proliferation of so-called Christian denominations was seen by Jesus as another part of the beginning of sorrows, which may also require a strong central government to control it. (Matthew 24:5)\nThe ecumenical movement is an attempt to reverse the trend toward more and more religious leaders claiming authority or an anointing from God. (\u0026lsquo;Christ\u0026rsquo; simply means \u0026lsquo;anointed one\u0026rsquo;.) A little diversity has turned into a lot of confusion, and churches everywhere are losing credibility because of their inability to get along with one another.\nUnfortunately, the remedy may prove worse than the disease. A single, monolithic religious structure, without a change in the hearts of the individuals within it, will only lead to atrocities against non-conformists, as always happens with religious/political dictatorships.\nIn all attempts toward religious union, not one union has been made with the teachings of Jesus as the basis for determining what to accept and what to reject. The builders have left out the Cornerstone, and what they are building will only amount to a false unity and a diabolical bride for the coming world dictator.\nThe Fall of America\nArmageddon (Revelation 16:16, Revelation 19:19-21) is a battle in which Russia and the forces of world communism are destroyed. (Tubal \u0026amp; Meshech in the Ezekiel 39 account have been translated by some as Tobolsk and Moscow.) The present (apparent) collapse of communism suggests Armageddon is over and it is time for the reign of Christ. But communism or the \u0026ldquo;Beast\u0026rdquo; that will rule the world has most likely only received a \u0026lsquo;deadly wound\u0026rsquo; from which it will soon recover. (Revelation 13:3-12)\nTwo symbolic powers exist in the last days: an atheistic anti-Christian \u0026ldquo;beast\u0026rdquo; which blasphemes God, and a \u0026ldquo;prostitute\u0026rdquo; which dominates world trade. The prostitute \u0026ldquo;sits on\u0026rdquo; the \u0026ldquo;beast\u0026rdquo; (Revelation 17:3-5) as America is doing with communism. But, with the help of ten other \u0026ldquo;kings\u0026rdquo; the Beast turns on the prostitute and destroys her with fire. (Revelation 17:16-17) The businessmen and shipping companies of the world will mourn the fall of capitalism \u0026ldquo;in one hour\u0026rdquo;. (Revelation 18)\nWorld Communism\nThe fall of America clears the way for a popular world government. Its leader will control a 10-nation council from which he receives his authority to govern (Daniel 7:24).\nA new economic policy will vastly increase production, resulting in worldwide prosperity. But the government will refuse to recognise God, and the world ruler will turn against all who have faith in God (Daniel 8:24-25).\nCommunism is the ultimate counterfeit of the kingdom of God (Acts 2:44-45). Though we support its ideals, we oppose its efforts to eliminate God. The use of religion by the rich and powerful to keep people in line is certainly wrong. But this is not what communism objects to. For communists too have used the institutional church as a tool of the state.\nThe False Super Church\nLeft-wing church leaders who lack courage to live and preach voluntary Christian communism are becoming more sympathetic to, and used by, world communism, to bring about change. But there is no such thing as a \u0026lsquo;just war\u0026rsquo; if it is led by unjust people. Only God himself is entitled to destroy life, and that is why human governments always seek the support of churches to justify their wars. The new world order will be no exception.\nIt seems the coming ruler will bring about universal religious harmony by rebuilding Solomon\u0026rsquo;s Temple in Jerusalem, thus allowing Jews to resume offering animal sacrifices. Plans have been put forward for a temple which would include an area for Jews, one for Muslims, and one for Christians.\nPassages in Daniel indicate that it will take just over seven months to build this temple, and that from its completion there will be less than six and a half years left until Jesus returns. (Daniel 9:27; Daniel 8:13-14) (The term \u0026ldquo;week\u0026rdquo; in the King James Bible is translated \u0026ldquo;7 years\u0026rdquo; in most other translations.)\nThe Great Tribulation\nThe period of religious tolerance and harmony under one world government will be short-lived. The Revelation depicts a period of great trouble, heralded by seven \u0026rsquo;trumpets\u0026rsquo; (Revelation 8-9). Jesus called it the \u0026lsquo;great tribulation\u0026rsquo;, and said he would return immediately after it. (Matthew 24:16-17) Paul said Jesus would return at the sound of the seventh trumpet (1 Corinthians 15:51-53, and 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).\nThe first six trumpets describe a global catastrophe which burns a third of the ships and kills a third of the animal life in the oceans. It tells of a \u0026lsquo;star\u0026rsquo; hitting the earth, the sky being darkened, and great hailstorms over much of the earth. Hailstorms and darkness are consistent with widespread fires filling the sky with smoke, and repeatedly forcing condensation far up into the atmosphere, where it would freeze and refreeze into giant hailstones. It is possible that the \u0026lsquo;star\u0026rsquo; (a giant meteor or deadly satellite) will be what causes the fires and sea deaths (maybe from tidal waves and radioactivity as well).\nThese disasters trigger off a global persecution of Christians by the world dictator, who will take over the temple in Jerusalem and cause the Jewish sacrifices to cease (Matthew 24:15-22, Daniel 11:31, Daniel 12:11). It may be that the dictator will blame Christians for the disasters. It will not be hard to convince the world that we did it if we have been predicting for years that it would happen!\nThere will be great confusion amongst the masses of churchgoers, who have been told that they would never have to go through this period (1 Thessalonians 5:3-4, 2 Thessalon-ians 2:3-4). Many will be killed (Daniel 7:21-25) because they have not learned to hear God\u0026rsquo;s voice above the clamour of religion. (Matthew 24:24-28) Idealists of many persuasions will look to Christians for leadership as they, too, flee from the colossal deception of the government in which they had put their trust (Daniel 11:32-35). Many of us will die during this period, but our witness will go into all the world. (Revelation 6:11, Revelation 7:14)\nThe Church in the Wilderness\nWhen the sacrifices cease, Christians around the world (referred to in the Revelation as the \u0026ldquo;Bride\u0026rdquo; of Christ) will be instructed by God to flee to secret hideouts which God has prepared for us. If necessary, he will give us supernatural assistance to reach our place of refuge (Revelation 12:6, Revelation 12:12-14) where we will survive (at least some of us) for 3 1/2 years until Jesus returns.\nRevelation 12 tells of a cosmic struggle between good and evil. The battle starts with the virgin Mary giving birth to Jesus as the Devil tries to destroy her son (Revelation 12:1-4) as Herod did in Matthew 2. Jesus eventually ascends to heaven, where he reigns in triumph over the devil. (Revelation 12:5-12)\nWhen the devil knows there is little time left before Jesus returns, he begins an all-out war on the \u0026lsquo;woman\u0026rsquo; and her descendants (Revelation 12:13, 17). Mary is symbolic of the true church or all true followers of Jesus (Luke 8:21). The sudden escape to the wilderness is described in Luke 17:28-37 where Jesus commands us not to delay when he tells us to move (Luke 17:31).\nIt seems that during this 3 1/2 year period immediately prior to the return of Jesus, and for 3 1/2 years immediately prior to that, the true church is at last a visible organisation (Daniel 9:27). God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit organises all truly sincere people in the world into 12 tribes of 12,000 people each, possibly in 12 different locations around the globe. (Revelation 7:4-8)\nThe 12 tribes don\u0026rsquo;t just \u0026lsquo;survive\u0026rsquo; during these final terrifying years. Instead, they actively recruit thousands (if not millions) of other believers, many of whom will be executed for their faith. (Revelation 7:9-14; Daniel 7:21, 25; Daniel 11:31-35)\nThere is no organisation you can join that can guarantee you will be part of this elite army. You can only prepare yourself by actively seeking the truth every day, and by learning to instantly obey anything God directs you to do.\nThe Mark of the Beast\nRevelation 13:15-18 says that all the world will be linked to a system which does not allow people to buy or sell without showing a mark that they have either in their hand or in their forehead. More and more economists are predicting exactly the same thing in the form of an implanted silicon chip which will identify every individual on earth.\nThe Bible gives solemn warning against ever accepting this mark (Revelation 14:9-12). It may be that the only way anyone who does accept it can be saved will be to take passages like Matthew 18:8 literally!\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/simple-salvation/","title":"Simple Salvation","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/Different_hu_71eec79391dd2478.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/Different_hu_97467c50dbacdd9d.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/Different_hu_5bc254f0853f4c17.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/Different_hu_64529c1b14da17d6.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Churches and Theology","tags":"Doctrine, Theology","content":"A member of The Family (formerly the Children of God) commented that he found it difficult to understand how we could consider them heretics and our best friends at the same time. Heretic is not a word that we would choose, because it has so much emotional judgment attached to it. But it is true that we have differences, at the same time that we have much in common; and we too have laboured to understand this paradox. The next five articles compare our similarities and difference on a number of teachings.\nFamily teaching is that if people say a little prayer and ask Jesus into their hearts, they are saved or \u0026ldquo;born again\u0026rdquo;, regardless of what they do with their lives from that point onwards.\nThe practice of saying a little prayer to \u0026ldquo;ask Jesus into your heart\u0026rdquo; was made popular by Billy Graham, and has proven to be extremely effective in recruiting converts to Protestant Churches of all denominations throughout the Twentieth Century. The Family have (at least in their earlier days) done on a massive one-to-one basis what Billy Graham has done in a crusade/rally setting. It would be hard to say which has had the greatest success.\nWe have often ridiculed this approach. However, we have recently given serious consideration to the possibility that we have not fairly considered its positive aspects. In a survey amongst our own members we found that a high percentage had said a little prayer asking Jesus into our hearts at some time in their spiritual development, and that most of them found the experience helpful.\nPraying a prayer to accept Jesus as your Saviour, or to ask him to \u0026ldquo;come into\u0026rdquo; (or better still, \u0026ldquo;to take over\u0026rdquo;) your life gives a new Christian a way to turn good intentions into an objective action, which can serve as a starting point to a whole new life. . Simplifying salvation into such a formula makes it easier to train others to \u0026ldquo;lead\u0026rdquo; people in making such a decision or commitment as well.\nOther Christians are more inclined to be patient with someone whom they regard as a new Christian (because the person has gone through this act of commitment). Such patience from others is important in the spiritual development of new Christians.\nHere is where The Family shines in a way that truly humbles us. Despite having received heavy persecution from established churches around the world, they continue to bend over backwards to get along with people within these churches\u0026hellip; based on their assumption that the churches are full of fellow Christians, toward whom they need only show enough love and patience and it will bring about the unity that Jesus prayed for in his church. This is truly amazing grace!\nDespite our admiration for such patience with the churches, however, we still see it as largely futile apart from the character that it builds in those who exercise such patience. We believe the vast majority of those who claim to be \u0026ldquo;Christian\u0026rdquo; are Christian in name only, and thus not Christian at all\u0026hellip; whether or not they ever said a \u0026ldquo;sinner\u0026rsquo;s prayer\u0026rdquo;. But is our approach the right one?\nJohn 1:12 says a person has the power to become a child of God simply by believing on the name of Jesus. If that was all we had to go by, then we could accept the Family approach. Just get everyone to say the magic name (whether or not they understand what it stands for) and you save the world!\nWas Constantine right? Can we build the kingdom of God by making Christianity the official religion, by outlawing all other religions, and by pressuring everyone to say the sinner\u0026rsquo;s prayer? Somehow we feel Jesus was pushing for something more spiritual and which requires deeper commitment than this.\nJesus said (Luke 6:46, 49) that just calling him \u0026ldquo;Lord\u0026rdquo; without obeying him would result in the collapse of our \u0026ldquo;house\u0026rdquo;. We have tried to understand John 1:12 in the context of all that Jesus taught, and our conclusion (based on all the teachings of Jesus) is that he does not have a category for disciples (i.e. Christians) who are not willing to be disciplined by him.\nWe take a different approach to John 1:12. It says that those who received Jesus were given the power to become children of God, including those who believed on His name. Putting a seed in the ground gives it a chance to sprout and become a plant. But in itself, it does not guarantee anything. There is so little in the life and teachings of Jesus or that of the apostles to suggest that we need only say a prayer and we will be eternally saved, that it is wise to at least consider the possibility that saying a prayer means nothing unless backed up by some deeper commitment or faith.\nThe danger of our approach (if it is wrong) is that we will fail to welcome people who do not take the teachings of Jesus as seriously as we do. To counteract that a little, we try to treat professing Christians as spiritual brothers and sisters until they show signs of clear rebellion against the teachings of Jesus. But we cannot reconcile faith in the \u0026ldquo;name\u0026rdquo; of Jesus with rebellion against what he taught. And we feel that this is consistent with what Jesus himself felt about such professions of faith.\nThe danger in the more liberal approach (if it is wrong) is that people may sidestep any unpleasant demands made on them by Jesus, simply by saying, \u0026quot; I said the sinner\u0026rsquo;s prayer; that\u0026rsquo;s all it takes.\u0026quot; Jesus\u0026rsquo;s story of God\u0026rsquo;s judgment at the end of the world (Matthew 25:31-46) tells of people assuming they were saved when they were not. They were Christian in name (though not in action) and consequently, \u0026ldquo;these shall go away into everlasting punishment; but the righteous into life eternal.\u0026rdquo; (verse 46)\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/smile-god-loves-you/","title":"Smile, God Loves You!","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/SmileG_hu_8b18a3b99ca6f60a.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"237\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/SmileG_hu_f1bdc05b5b842ff1.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/SmileG_hu_37796a7f41aecb13.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/SmileG_hu_b21479088e6914c4.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Top Forty","tags":"Positive","content":"There is a greater sin than not obeying Jesus; it is the sin of not believing that he loves you.\nWhen you believe another person has your best interests at heart, you can accept great difficulties on behalf of that person.

Some want to become evangelists and move from church to church preaching to the congregations. Some see themselves more as prophets, with a message of judgment on the churches. Others have set up their own websites, on which they have posted articles on various subjects. There have even been a few who have set about to start their own Christian communities.\nWe are pleased to be able to contribute some small part in these bold efforts. However, we do have a serious word of caution to each of these people. We have generally found that there is a quantum leap between starting your own ministry and actually trying to serve God. One focuses on how you are going to change others, whereas the other focuses on how God is going to change us.\nThere are a number of reasons why these people do not want to work with us. The most common is greed. Money equals power, and if they were to forsake all of their power to a community that is bigger than themselves, then they could no longer be in control of all that they do. With enough money, they can come and go as they please. They can indulge themselves when they feel like it. They can use the money to buy themselves recognition and even friends from time to time.\nOf course this unwillingness to forsake all private ownership (as happens when one joins a Jesus Christian community) is closely linked with another barrier to co-operation, and that is pride. Some issues linked to money in the previous paragraph contain an element of pride too: personal recognition and personal control.\nThen there is fear\u0026hellip; usually quite an irrational fear. The devil can make people imagine some really bizarre possibilities about what is going to happen to them if they move in and start working with us. He does it to keep them out there on their own. Because the list is so long and varied, we won\u0026rsquo;t even begin to state the possibilities here. The point is, however, that fear is hardly a sound Christian motive for doing anything.\nFinally, there is lust: Most often sexual freedom (although it can involve such things as drug addiction as well). We live in a sex-crazed world, and we Jesus Christians are trying to live sexually chaste lives. For people who have never learned to control their sexual desires, or at least to express them in scripturally acceptable ways, such control is anathema.\nSo what kind of a \u0026ldquo;ministry\u0026rdquo; is going to grow from greed, pride, fear, and lust? Usually, no ministry at all. Most of these people have fallen or will fall flat on their faces.\nThe answer isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily to give up hope of having your own ministry, nor is it necessarily that you should join us. God can teach you the same lessons through almost anyone\u0026hellip; a fellow evangelist, a spouse or lover, your local church. Considering all of the problems that are going to come out of such an uncommitted life, we would rather have you learn them from someone else anyway. Then come to us when you\u0026rsquo;ve learned them all. :o)\nSeriously, we will do what we can to help you overcome these problems. It won\u0026rsquo;t be easy, but it\u0026rsquo;s part of the recipe for a truly humble, truly loving, truly obedient ministry of faith in God, and not faith in ourselves.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/as-hard-as-a-rock/","title":"Solid As A Rock","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/hesu/Rock_hu_a5a318dacbca4f12.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/hesu\\/Rock_hu_fa2efa8a15f8c1c3.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/hesu/Rock_hu_7448f5752b2777ee.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/hesu\\/Rock_hu_e3305cf71e75aae2.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Jesus and Money","tags":"The Teachings of Jesus, Money","content":"It has not been easy for people to build a case against us and our teachings for one very important reason: We have built our faith on the most solid foundation anyone could ever choose for any religion.\nJesus said that anyone who \u0026ldquo;hears these sayings of mine and obeys them will be like a wise man who builds his house on a rock. When the storms come and beat upon that house, it will not fall.\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 7:24-25)\nWe are fanatically committed to following the teachings of Jesus. No report on us would be complete without mentioning it. Our faith in Jesus opens the door for us to receive God\u0026rsquo;s free gift of salvation. And our faith is made evident by our efforts (imperfect though they may be) to structure all that we do and say on the basis of what he has taught us.\nIt is our faith in Jesus and all that he taught, that has given us a kind of immunity to the attacks of the cult-busters. They will, of course, eventually succeed in destroying us personally and physically; but they will never stop the truth of the Rock on which we stand.\nCult-busters display their own hypocrisy when they accuse us of trying to work our way to heaven by obeying Jesus. All they can offer as an alternative is that we should deliberately disobey Jesus to prove our faith in God\u0026rsquo;s grace. How absurd!\nThey can condemn us for being poor, for being zealously evangelistic, for breaking social traditions, for being prepared to lay down our lives in love. But the more they condemn us, the more they condemn themselves.\nParadoxically, we are becoming more popular and more hated at the same time. If it were all popularity, we might have cause to worry that we had compromised our faith in order to gain it; and if it were all persecution, we might wonder whether we were just trouble-makers, with nothing positive to offer. But we are getting a fair bit of both reactions to what we say and do.\nOur hope is that eventually the entire world will hear what we are saying in spite of the cult-busters (in some cases because of them!); and that they will all be given a chance to choose between the lie of perverted grace (i.e. that it is sinful to try to obey Jesus), the lie of false works (i.e. obey the government; obey your parents; obey your pastor; obey your boss; obey anyone, but don\u0026rsquo;t obey Jesus), and childlike faith in, and obedience to, Jesus.\nWe might add that the real error in cults like the Children of God (the one they try hardest to link us with) is the same as that of the born-againers: Both say they are free to break the rules because they are under God\u0026rsquo;s grace, little realising that God\u0026rsquo;s grace is given to those whom he chooses (and he does not choose to give it to those who wilfully reject the teachings and disciplines of his Son).\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/space-without-spice/","title":"Space Without Spice","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/pamu/SpaceW_hu_6a9d8dc101ca592e.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/pamu\\/SpaceW_hu_312cc715f84d0876.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/pamu/SpaceW_hu_959b8904b6df5848.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/pamu\\/SpaceW_hu_b8f193d06d9b8424.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Leadership","tags":"Practical, Guidance","content":"This article is a continuation of a topic which has been coming up a lot in the past couple of years. It deals with the dilemma that exists when a leader (or the community as a whole) encounters someone who shows some good spiritual signs, but who also shows an unwillingness to deal with some particular weakness or fault. Our traditional approach has been to take a grievance with the offender, and to advance the grievance from first stage to second, to third, and finally to kick them out of the community if they continue their refusal to deal with the offence. The process is scriptural and beneficial.\nBut at some stage we discovered that it was also helpful to give the person some \u0026ldquo;space\u0026rdquo; away from the accusations of the people in the grievance meeting, so that they could \u0026ldquo;think about\u0026rdquo; what was being said. We each recognise that criticism is often difficult to immediately accept. Rightly or wrongly, our first reaction to criticism generally seems to be to defend ourselves, to deny the problem, to blame it on circumstances or on someone else. But time away from the rest of the community usually helps us to get things into better perspective.\nOne of the big reasons why \u0026ldquo;space\u0026rdquo; is helpful is because, away from our critics, we do not have to deal with the knee-jerk pride that rears up the moment we are criticised. We are able to think things out, to weigh up the alternatives to accepting the criticism (e.g. being kicked out of the community), and to devise tactful ways to win ourselves back into favour with the rest of the community. Each of these points represents a spiritual compromise of sorts, a way around really smashing our pride and accepting the bitter truth the first time we hear it. But we have given people this time out mechanism because we ourselves are not perfect, and because we too suffer from the same problem when criticised.\nWhat we really want, whether in a time out situation or in the grievance meeting itself, is for people to be totally yielded to God. Giving people space may cause them to use that space to their own selfish advantage, and not to genuinely seek God on the matter. But confronting them too harshly may also cause them to cave in to the overwhelming opinion of the majority, rather than genuinely hearing from God and internalising the truth that he is trying to teach them.\nWe need to see that our job as individuals as well as our job as a community is to build the kingdom of heaven, and not just to be building our own organisation. It may actually be better for the kingdom of heaven for some people to be outside of our community. We may need to give them \u0026ldquo;space\u0026rdquo; to actually leave the community in order to sort things out between themselves and God. The reason for this is because the close confines of the community exert a powerful \u0026ldquo;peer group pressure\u0026rdquo; on people to conform to the will of the majority; and this pressure can take the place of God in a group member\u0026rsquo;s life. In order to build the kingdom of heaven, we must get people to see beyond conforming to the will of the community, and to discover conformity to the will of God.\nPeople who leave the community often leave with a feeling of bitterness, because they say that they were forced to exercise disciplines in the community that they didn\u0026rsquo;t really want to do. It may be that they were too gutless to speak up. Or it may be that they were too selfish to co-operate. But we should not overlook the possibility that it may also be that we were too impatient about getting them to \u0026ldquo;fit in\u0026rdquo; and we did not allow them space to fully appreciate the reasoning behind some group disciplines. In cases where it is impractical or impossible for someone to stay within the community and still do their own thing, then they may need to actually leave the community in order to find enough space to sort the issue through.\nWhen this happens, it is easy to label the person as a backslider, a rebel, a trouble-maker, or some other equally offensive title. Whether these titles are true or not, they still constitute an attempt by the community to add \u0026ldquo;spice\u0026rdquo; to the space that we are giving the person. We want to go with them into their time out, and we want to be able to shake a finger in their face, to remind them that they are wrong and we are right\u0026hellip; we want to rub a little salt into the wound\u0026hellip; for their own good, of course! When this happens, however, we are not really giving them time to sort themselves out with God, because we are still trying to get them to sort themselves out with us.\nGod is so incredibly patient with people. He gives us a lifetime to decide what we are going to do with our lives. Most of us make some terrible decisions, and we will have to pay eternally for those decisions. But God gives us the freedom to do that. In this lifetime, the emphasis is on free will. All the evidence seems to indicate that people have abused that freedom. Adam and Eve abused it in the Garden of Eden, and virtually everyone since then has done the same thing.\nBut God seems to be willing to lose all those people for the sake of a single Noah or a single Abraham. Noah and Abraham had no group to exert pressure on them to conform with the will of God. They lived in a totally pagan world, and yet they each followed their conscience until they found God\u0026rsquo;s will for their life.\nBecause of Abraham\u0026rsquo;s hunger to know the truth, God met with him and worked at communicating some disciplines for him and his descendants. The problem is that his descendants did not have the same hunger to know the truth, and so they just conformed to the rules that their ancestors had received from God, and they conformed to peer group pressure more than they conformed to the will of God.\nSo that is when God sent Jesus to give us this new concept of the invisible kingdom of heaven. Of course, some aspects of it were not all that new. They were much like what Abraham and Noah had experienced, i.e. no visible religion to tell them what was right or wrong, just the Spirit of God speaking to their heart and convicting them of sin. Follow that still, small voice today, and you will become an Abraham or a Noah; ignore it and you will become like the rest of the world around them.\nIn order for us to build that kind of a kingdom, we must give people enough rope to hang themselves. By that, I mean that we must give them enough space to totally backslide without a single finger being shook in their faces. And it helps to understand that they are no more backslidden if they go off into sin outside the community than they are if they stay in the community and conform only out of peer group pressure. The fact that most people won\u0026rsquo;t listen to and obey the voice of God should not make us compromise on the truth. The \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo; is the message we shout to people every day on the streets: \u0026ldquo;Follow Jesus or go to hell!\u0026rdquo; But the truth also implies, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t follow us.\u0026rdquo; And one half needs to be preached as well as the other.\nSure, we know that people will abuse the message about not following us, and they will run off to follow their own selfish impulses. But they can also abuse the message about following Jesus, by conforming to our community expectations without true conviction.\nWhat I am suggesting here, for those of you who want to be true spiritual leaders in the kingdom of heaven, is that we must learn to let go of our followers, to watch them run off and do things their own way, and still love them and pray for them, and actually encourage them in those areas where they are showing signs of growth. We may need to accept that they will never get over the problem that led them away from us to begin with. But whether or not they do, is between them and God.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know how God draws the lines, but it seems that people are capable of being in the kingdom of God in some areas of their lives even though they are out in other areas. While we are encouraging them in those areas where they want to grow, we are building the kingdom of heaven. And we can build the kingdom of heaven in virtually anyone we meet, simply by encouraging the spark of God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit that is in them. The rest of what they do (which seems so contrary to the will of God) we need to leave for God to sort out. In fact, the patience that we show toward them when they choose to exercise their free will unwisely is a part of our growth in the virtues of the kingdom of heaven.\nI have been experimenting a bit with this, and I think that this kind of patience can actually help some people to grow in a way that badgering them could not. I know that it has already forced me to work on my own relationship with God more, as I consider the possibility that I may lose the people I love so dearly, and see them destroy their own lives in the process, if I don\u0026rsquo;t wave my arms and shout to warn them. But I\u0026rsquo;ve had many years to see that waving my arms and shouting has not always worked either. I find myself actually growing into a kind of isolation spiritually where I just work on my own relationship with God, and leave everyone else to sort themselves out. Scary stuff; but it\u0026rsquo;s really quite liberating. In fact, it seems to be what the kingdom of God is all about. Maybe this isolation from feeling responsible for correcting everyone is just the space that each of us leaders needs as well as the followers!\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/surely-not-all-evil/","title":"Surely, Not All Evil","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/hesu/Money_hu_b95fd5870f427b30.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"630\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/hesu\\/Money_hu_c7aa6d41ab43ecd5.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/hesu/Money_hu_55e9373de7912569.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/hesu\\/Money_hu_b3a9038d78e1beef.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Jesus and Money","tags":"The Teachings of Jesus, Living By Faith, Money","content":"St. Paul wrote a letter to a young Christian, and said that the root of all evil is the love of money. (1 Timothy 6:10) This is an amazing claim.\nPerhaps too much love for too much money we could go along with, or perhaps we could agree that it is the cause of some evils\u0026hellip; maybe even a lot of evils. But to just come right out and say that all love for any amount of money is the cause of all evils is a bit much for most people to take.\nYou only need to quote the verse as it is written, to get a reaction from the average churchgoer. Try it, and see if they don\u0026rsquo;t say something like, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s the love of money, mind you, not money itself.\u0026rdquo; They then go on to tell you how they know of a lot of rich people who have accomplished a lot for God.\nWhat is happening when they respond like this? Let\u0026rsquo;s change the issue slightly to make it clearer. Suppose someone says that drug addiction is ruining Western society, and a reaction comes back, stating that it\u0026rsquo;s not the drugs themselves, but addiction that is the problem. Suppose they go on to inform you that they know of many people who take drugs regularly, but that they are confident that these friends are not addicted, and that taking drugs does not affect their ability to live a happy, normal life. Why do you suppose the person would react in such a way? There is a line from Shakespeare which says, \u0026ldquo;Me thinks thou dost protest too much.\u0026rdquo; In other words, when someone feels heavily convicted by the truth in a statement, they tend to overreact, and this overreaction (or \u0026ldquo;protesting\u0026rdquo; too much) actually gives away their guilt.\nModern Bible translators have had a problem with this verse, because they know it is offensive to most church people. The King James Version faithfully expresses the thought of the passage. The original Greek does say that greed is the source of all evils. So how could the translators soften it and still avoid being accused of distorting the original message? The Bible Society came up with an ingenious solution for the Today\u0026rsquo;s English Version. They wrote: \u0026ldquo;The love of money is a source of all kinds of evil.\u0026rdquo; Apart from the dishonest use of the word \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo;, they have technically used the word \u0026ldquo;all\u0026rdquo;. The problem is that they have used it in a phrase which has an idiomatic meaning that is rarely taken literally. \u0026ldquo;All kinds of\u0026rdquo; just means \u0026ldquo;lots\u0026rdquo;. It does not mean \u0026ldquo;all\u0026rdquo; at all.\nSurely, if greed is the root cause of all other evils, then it should be the fundamental target of any campaign to bring righteousness to the world. It stands to reason that if we could rid the world of the root of all evil, then the eventual consequence would be a world without any evil in it at all. But where is the church, denomination, or religion that is waging such a campaign against greed? The truth is that the entire topic of greed, and especially greedy people (presumably the rich) get very light treatment from religions everywhere.\nBut let us start by taking the more popular approach to this passage, which is that for one reason or another, Paul never intended to say what he is recorded as having said in 1 Timothy 6:10. Let us assume that the love of money (while harmful if overdone) isn\u0026rsquo;t all that bad, and certainly is not the cause of all the problems in the world. Let us assume that the 1 Timothy 6:10 passage slipped into the Bible by mistake, or that it was placed there by an overzealous monk in the very early days of the church.\nIf that is so, then we would expect the subject to be dropped. We should not be bothered by other passages promoting such an extreme teaching. We would certainly not find Jesus or the apostles teaching such nonsense. The battle between good and evil for them would be more of one between God and the devil, perhaps with something like pride or a lust for power (and not greed) being the real source of evil in the world.\nIn the gospels, Jesus tells us that we have a choice between good and evil, and we cannot \u0026ldquo;serve\u0026rdquo; both \u0026ldquo;masters\u0026rdquo;. The picture is that of an employee, or servant, trying to work for two employers or bosses at the same time.\nPresumably one employer would be God, and the other would be the Devil. Right? But no, that is not how Jesus describes them. He does say that one employer is God, but he says that the other employer is (wait for it) money, or \u0026ldquo;mammon\u0026rdquo; (mammon is a term for money which also includes the material things that money can buy). Jesus says that we cannot work for God and work for money at the same time. (Matthew 6:24, and Luke 16:13) How amazing! He goes on to say that we are going to end up despising or hating one employer or the other. Between this approach and the one taken by Paul, there is no room left for a person to be neutral, either with regard to God or with regard to money. We are going to end up loving one and hating the other. It\u0026rsquo;s not a matter of loving one just a little bit more than the other, but rather a matter of putting them on opposite ends of the spectrum.\nOne is going to be our god, and the other is going to be our worst enemy. We must choose.\nIt is consistent with the picture of one employee trying to work for two employers at the same time. The employee is obviously going to have to cheat one employer in order to turn up at work for the other. His or her \u0026ldquo;hate\u0026rdquo; for the cheated employer will take the form of trying to rip off wages for something that he or she is not entitled to.\nCould it be that many religious people are trying to rip off, or claim something from God (eternal life) when they are not really entitled to it? The immediate argument that we face with regard to such a question is the widespread belief amongst professing Christians that we do not have to do anything to be entitled to eternal life. Salvation, they say, is our \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo;; we\u0026rsquo;re entitled to it, whether or not we ever turn up for work.\nBut this is totally false. When questioned more closely, they will all admit that salvation only comes through faith. And almost all of them will say that this faith must be placed in Jesus Christ. So how much faith do they have in what Jesus has said about working for God in preference to working for money? For that matter, how much faith do they have in anything that Jesus instructed his followers to do?\nJesus said that unless we stop working for mammon, or material wealth (John 6:27) and start working for him (Matthew 11:29) we will be regarded as an employee who has tried to rip off the most powerful Employer in the Universe. He said to stop worrying about food and clothes, and how we are going to get them (Matthew 6:25-33), and seek first to build God\u0026rsquo;s multinational kingdom of love instead. He said that, if we will do that, God himself will take care of our material needs. He said that we should forsake all of our material wealth if we want to be one of his disciples. (Luke 14:33)\nSo what has the church done with these and other specific instructions about challenging the root of all evil? They have told us that all of these teachings of Jesus and Paul mean little more than that we should try to moderate our greed. It\u0026rsquo;s okay to spend your life making money if you are doing it for your family, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t engage in anything immoral or illegal to do so, and if you make a point of giving a percentage of it to the church. \u0026ldquo;Forsaking\u0026rdquo; wealth, they say, just means sharing a bit of it with the right people from time to time.\nThere is a kind of mythical image in the churches of an incredibly greedy person who swims in pools full of diamonds and rubs money all over himself or herself as an act of worship. Church people know that they should not want to be like that person.\nOn the other hand, is there a record anywhere in the history of the entire institutional church (of all denominations) of anyone ever being excommunicated because of being too greedy?\nThe truth is that absolutely any excess of greed can be tolerated by any church in the world. As long as you don\u0026rsquo;t break a short list of other rules, you can swim in all the diamonds you like, and just between you and me, the more diamonds you have, the more profusely they will welcome you! It is precisely because of this unwillingness to forsake wealth and to attack greed, that the church has been largely ineffectual in saving the world. Love of money in the world has caused wars, exploited the poor, led to drug trafficking, corrupted politicians, and much more. And love of money in the church has made the church virtually useless in changing present trends away from God. Daily, the world grows richer materially, but it also grows daily more and more destitute spiritually.\nIn the middle of the Sermon on the Mount, and in the middle of his discourse on greed, Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;The eyes are like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are clear, your whole body will be full of light; but if your eyes are bad, your body will be in darkness. So if the light in you turns out to be darkness, how terribly dark it will be!\u0026rdquo; (Matthew 6:22-23, TEV) In other words, if the church, and individual Christians cannot get it clear with regard to his teachings on money, then Jesus is saying that they will not only be useless, but they will be seen as contributors to the \u0026ldquo;terrible darkness\u0026rdquo; that the world is in today.\nI have found that this teaching on money is the key to understanding all of life. It is in this same chapter that Jesus makes reference to King Solomon, who was believed to have been the wisest person on earth when he was alive.\nJesus says that Solomon, with all his riches, was not clothed as beautifully as God has clothed the flowers of the fields.\nIn another place (Matthew 12:42) he refers to a story that is recorded in the tenth chapter of 1 Kings, when he says that the Queen of Sheba travelled halfway around the world to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and yet \u0026ldquo;one greater than Solomon is here\u0026rdquo;. There is, in accepting this teaching of Jesus about money, the key to discovering wisdom that Solomon barely scratched the surface of.\nThe final book of the Bible continues with the theme of good and evil. It describes evil as a Prostitute (Revelation 17:5) and good as a Bride (Revelation 19:7). Both women give what our modern society has come to call \u0026ldquo;love\u0026rdquo;, but one does it freely, while the other does it for money.\nArtists commonly refer to \u0026ldquo;prostituting\u0026rdquo; themselves if they let greed influence their work. And each of us does the same thing when we use the life and gifts that God has given us, to make money rather than using it to freely share him and his message of faith and love with the rest of the world.\nThe Prostitute is given a name. She is called \u0026ldquo;Babylon\u0026rdquo;. The name symbolises all of the worldly empires of human history. Babylon in particular is most famous for having invented money. They did not invent greed, because greed existed even in the days of bartering, but they did invent a much more efficient way for people to satisfy their greed.\nGold coins were the first form of money, but it has evolved through various forms over the centuries, as the rich have become more and more rich.\nThe Revelation also compares God to a \u0026ldquo;Lamb\u0026rdquo; that loses its life to save the world (Revelation 5:6). The antithesis of this poor slain lamb is a warring \u0026ldquo;Beast\u0026rdquo;. The Beast is represented by a \u0026ldquo;Mark\u0026rdquo;, which will eventually be placed on the back of everyone\u0026rsquo;s hand or on their forehead, and without which they will not be able to buy or sell (Revelation 13:16-18). This is the ultimate step in the evolution of money, and it was prophesied in the Bible almost 2,000 years ago!\nIt is gradually becoming common knowledge that the world is just about at that point in history when the prophesied Mark will be put into worldwide circulation, in the form of a microchip implant on the back of the hand (or on the forehead if your hand has been amputated). People will be able to wave their hand in front of a scanner to electronically transfer funds from one account to another in the fast approaching \u0026ldquo;cashless society\u0026rdquo;. This is not fanatical raving. It is all coming together right now. You can read about it almost anywhere in the secular Press.\nThe Bible says that anyone who accepts that Mark will be eternally damned. (Revelation 14:9-10)\nSo is the church concerned about it? Are meetings being held to adjust their financial structure in order to survive without taking it? Of course not. In fact, if the subject comes up at all, it is quickly followed by arguments in favour of the Mark, and against those who see it as evil. The root of all evil is leading the institutional church straight into the hands of the Prince of Darkness himself, and all it took was the love of money to do it.\nThere is an interesting little note in the passage from The Revelation about the Mark of the Beast. It says, \u0026ldquo;Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the Beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.\u0026rdquo; (Revelation 13:18)\nHere is wisdom. Wisdom has gradually become the all-consuming goal of my life, from the time that I first heard about King Solomon being given one request, and how he asked for wisdom. I want to know the truth. I want to have a sincere heart. I want to hunger and thirst after righteousness. I want wisdom. And so this passage tells me that I should seek to understand the meaning of the number 666 if I wish to have it.\nI decided to get a huge Bible concordance and see if the number 666 appears anywhere else in the Bible. I found that it does. The number 666 appears in only one other place, and that, strangely enough, is the very same chapter that Jesus was referring to when he talked about having greater wisdom than Solomon. It is in 1 Kings 10:14.\nThis is the chapter that tells us that the Queen of Sheba brought many gifts to Solomon, in exchange for hearing his wisdom. Others also came bearing gifts. And in one year, Solomon received 666 talents of gold as payment for hearing his wisdom. See, Solomon had a wisdom of sorts, but then he used it to make money. Jesus had greater wisdom, which saw through the money myth. He saw that love for money was the root of all evil.\nMy search for wisdom had started with Solomon; but it had taken me full circle back to Solomon. And the paradox is that, on returning to Solomon, I discovered that he was the counterfeit of the real thing. There is something better than Solomon, and it is the teachings of Jesus. The teachings of Jesus tell me that 666 talents of gold is worthless (whether it is in goods, gold ingots, cash, cheques, stocks, or e-money), that faith in God and a handful of wild flowers is worth more than all of this. The teachings of Jesus tell me that I could have all the wealth of the world, be a powerful king, have women circling the globe to listen to me, and still I would have nothing if I would not follow God. The teachings of Jesus tell me that the relatively short history of the human race has been little more than an experiment, to see whether we would spend our lives working for the source of all goodness or whether we would spend our lives working for the root of all evil. Our eternal destiny rests on which \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; we chose to work for.\nWhat I have covered in this article has been the root of all evil, and the \u0026ldquo;key\u0026rdquo; to destroying it. There is so much more that could be said. But none of it will do us any good unless we are prepared to act on the truth of what Jesus has said. Our talk about faith and love and sincerity all crumbles into meaningless babble unless we are prepared, in obedience to the Creator of the Universe, to turn loose of our wealth and dedicate our lives to helping others and obeying God\u0026hellip; without thought for food or clothing.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/take-the-press-and-follow-me/","title":"Take Up the Press and Follow Me","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/lefto/Press_hu_be0c44cca355fe49.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"236\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/lefto\\/Press_hu_1cc05e651880f67b.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/lefto/Press_hu_92f43e2e828f8b4.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/lefto\\/Press_hu_3eaf6befbe5ca657.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Leftovers","tags":"Practical, Random","content":"The secular media has been around for a long time.

At least today we can monitor and document the distortions. Messages passed on by word-of-mouth alone can be garbled beyond recognition by the time they have passed through half a dozen mouths; yet this was all that early Christians had. For those first Christians, the one thing worse than a garbled message was no message at all. They had a commission to reach the whole world, and they sought every means at their disposal to fulfil it.\nThroughout church history there have been people who have opposed the invention of the printing press, translation of the Bible into the language of the people, the use of art, radio, and television as tools for communicating the gospel. All of these advances represented new risks for Christianity. But they also represented new possibilities. Unfortunately, the devil has stolen the lead in taking advantage of improved media to get across his message of hate, fear, greed, and lust.\nThose who fear misrepresentation from the media overlook the fact that misunderstandings also exist when we say nothing at all. (i.e. The general public only hear the opposition\u0026rsquo;s point of view when we say nothing.) The entire Western world is being brainwashed from infancy by television, radio, and the press. If we do not speak up, we lose by default. It is our job to challenge at least some of the lies, even if we cannot stop all of them\u0026hellip; and even if our efforts spawn new lies.\nIt is fair enough for Christians to seek to avoid all appearance of evil\u0026hellip; but only if we include indifference to the world\u0026rsquo;s spiritually deprived masses as one of the evils we do not want to appear to be guilty of. While we drag our heels in approaching the mass media, we appear to be guilty of exactly that.\nOur job is not to avoid criticism by doing nothing. Our job is to preach the gospel in whatever way works. Christians have lost their appreciation for all that the cross implies when we cling to the myth of our own theological perfection and spotless reputations. Have we forgotten that our Leader was executed as a common criminal? The Apostle Paul said that this fact was his greatest boast.\nThe proof of our faith in the resurrection comes from our willingness to endure the reproach of the cross. All great moments in history came when people took risks. And all great men of faith were misrepresented at times.\nBut that did not stop them.\nA careful study of what attracts the interest of the secular media has led us to discover that Jesus was an expert on mass communication. He specialised in short, pithy statements that aroused interest and provoked controversy (e.g. \u0026ldquo;eat my flesh and drink my blood,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;He that drinks the water I give will never thirst again,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;You must be born again\u0026rdquo;). (John 6:56, John 4:14, John 3:7)\nHe also knew how to sidestep leading questions with answers like \u0026ldquo;Render to Caesar that which is Caesar\u0026rsquo;s and to God that which is God\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; (Mark 12:17) or \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll answer that question if you\u0026rsquo;ll answer this one\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; (Luke 20:3)\nHe recognised the power of a story or an action to illustrate a point far better than a deep, reasoned argument. The cross itself became the ultimate action to illustrate the ultimate argument.\nAnd he certainly was not afraid to be misunderstood, as was the case when he made the cryptic comment about destroying his temple (or body) and raising it up again in three days. (John 2:19) It was that comment which finally brought him into court as a would-be terrorist, planning to destroy the Temple. (Mark 14:58)\nWe have tried to apply some of these same principles in our approach to the media today. We have been misquoted, criticised, laughed at, and condemned. But we have also been heard, and the message has gone out to millions.\nOn the whole, we think it has been a pretty good exchange.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/teach-others-to-teach-others/","title":"Teach Others To Teach Others","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/pamu/Study_hu_961b2d45106aa1a6.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"278\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/pamu\\/Study_hu_c9cd6fdb62b2d758.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/pamu/Study_hu_1a6954f86ec6ee31.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/pamu\\/Study_hu_2a40ee8ab679e028.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Leadership","tags":"Practical, Wisdom, Guidance","content":"\u0026ldquo;Study to show yourself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\u0026rdquo; (2 Timothy 2:15)\nWhenever I have heard or used this passage from the New Testament, the picture that has come to mind has been of someone faithfully poring over a textbook or memorising Bible verses. Never mind that the Bible as we now know it did not even exist at that time.\nBut lately I have been enabled (with a little prodding from my wife) to see it from a perspective that is more consistent with the circumstances under which it was first written; and the result has been a far more exciting picture of what it means. I will attempt to explain that in this article.\nThe two words that seem to jump out at us in the passage above are \u0026ldquo;study\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;word\u0026rdquo;. Because of these two words, it seems quite reasonable to think that the passage is talking about studying a book of some sort. But when the Apostle Paul was writing that in a letter to young Timothy, the New Testament had not even been fully written, and even the Old Testament was not available to the average believer. Books as such rarely existed in the average home. So what could he have been talking about?\nBecause the passage talks about us needing to be \u0026ldquo;approved unto God\u0026rdquo;, we get the idea that he was talking about something important. Tradition has said that studying the Bible is important, to the point where the Bible almost BECOMES God. But if it\u0026rsquo;s not specifically the Bible that Paul was encouraging Timothy to study, then what was it? If we really want to please God, the answer to this question should be worth searching for.\nAnother phrase suggests that it may have something to do with some kind of practical skills. Paul talks about a \u0026ldquo;workman who needeth not to be ashamed\u0026rdquo;. Certainly in any type of work, whether painting a car, planting onions, filling in tax forms, or preaching a sermon, it is important for \u0026ldquo;workmen\u0026rdquo; to be able to do jobs for which they need not be ashamed. So it is possible that the \u0026ldquo;study\u0026rdquo; we are talking about here is as simple as doing a good job at school, in an apprenticeship, or when working for an employer\u0026hellip; so that you become a \u0026ldquo;workman/workwoman who does not need to be ashamed\u0026rdquo; of the work you are doing.\nBut then there is the final phrase: \u0026ldquo;rightly dividing the word of truth\u0026rdquo;. This suggests something more than a well designed cabinet or a well executed jump shot in basketball. There is something about the kind of studying that Paul is encouraging that will help someone to find truth, and more than that, to be able to divide or discern the truth from what is untruth. This phrase in itself should have told us years ago that the verse is probably not talking about the Bible OR about getting ahead in our jobs.\nMy own feeling (now) is that this is talking about discernment, about wisdom, about counsel, about thinking. God wants us to think\u0026hellip; to use our minds\u0026hellip; to consider the issues that are put before us daily and try to discern the best way to apply them in our lives.\nLately I have been thinking a lot about \u0026ldquo;counselling\u0026rdquo; and the need for all members of any organisation or community to take an active part in decision-making. It means being able to debate the issues in our minds, to consider the pros and cons, to \u0026ldquo;trouble-shoot\u0026rdquo;. Yet these seem to be some of the rarest traits in the world today. Everywhere you look there are people who are prepared to become puppets for the nearest puppet-master. They don\u0026rsquo;t want to think; they just want someone else to make the decisions for them, so that they can take comfort in the fact that they are in safe hands.\nThis picture of mindless zombies is often presented with regard to new religious movements, and yet it is, in my opinion, far more prevalent in the workaday world. There are people who reach retirement and just can\u0026rsquo;t handle the responsibility of having to decide for themselves when to get up in the morning, what to do throughout the day, and when to change from one thing to another. It all reflects the way they have lived their lives, never questioning, and rarely taking initiative. Sadly, the world is full of people who are only too ready to enlist as pawns for the nearest power-broker.\nFor almost 30 years my oldest son lived with me and worked with me in the Christian community that my wife and I set up. He was one of the most helpful members of that community, and all because of his ability to question things, and to argue his case well. True, his disagreements used to drive me up the wall at times, but even when he seemed to be arguing just for the sake of arguing, it required him to think. As a result, I knew that if he was left in charge of any situation, he would be pretty much able to handle it. And all because he had learned to think.\nI never took debating in school, but it sounds like one of the best subjects one can take. Most people think, \u0026ldquo;Ugh! Arguments! I hate them. How depressing! How negative!\u0026rdquo; But, of course, what happens on a debating team is that they teach you to argue whichever side you are instructed to argue, and not just the one that you would prefer. In other words, overall, you are forced to consider both sides, all of the pros and cons. In short, you learn to think.\nI wish that more Christian believers would actually learn to question their faith at times, just so that they can think through the issues and come out more convincing and more convinced in what it is that they do believe. Thinking outside the box will invariably generate controversy, but all of that will better equip you for whatever it is that you ultimately decide to do with your life. Whatever it is that we believe or do right now will eventually become dead traditions if we don\u0026rsquo;t know why we chose them, and if we are not continuing to keep the issues clear in our own minds and in the minds of others.\nI was thinking about the word \u0026ldquo;rational\u0026rdquo; the other day. It comes from the same root word as \u0026ldquo;reason\u0026rdquo; and we often talk about \u0026ldquo;reasoning\u0026rdquo; as a form of arguing. But more than that, the word \u0026ldquo;reason\u0026rdquo; on its own is linked with the word \u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; And that\u0026rsquo;s the word we need to be asking ourselves constantly if we want to keep from losing our way. Why are we doing this? Why do we think it is important? Why does someone else oppose it? Why were we put here on this planet? If we are not questioning our motives and the motives of those around us, we are sooner or later going to start sounding pretty irrational (i.e. \u0026ldquo;without reason\u0026rdquo;).\nSome people go quiet in a discussin because they say that they are not good at arguing their position. But you don\u0026rsquo;t become a good basketball player by only playing chess. It\u0026rsquo;s practice that makes perfect, and if you know that you are inexperienced in arguing your point, then even that little piece of truth should help you to be more tentative and humble in the points you try to make.\nSuccessfully arguing a point is not just a matter of being able to rant and rave. It comes from thinking seriously about what you believe and from being able to honestly examine the weaknesses as well as the strong points. With practice, you will gain more confidence, and you will be prepared for the counter-arguments that your own statements are going to elicit, so that you don\u0026rsquo;t put your foot in your mouth (or at least not so often)!\nIn closing, let me encourage everyone to take practical steps toward kicking their brains into gear on any of the hundreds of issues that surround you every day. Think about what could go wrong. Think about what could work. Listen to what others are saying. Then move forward with confidence as well as humility, knowing that you are actively seeking to be \u0026ldquo;a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth\u0026rdquo; in all that you do.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/the-day-the-earth-stood-still/","title":"The Day The Earth Stood Still","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/lefto/Theater_hu_64b0de634b8df652.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/lefto\\/Theater_hu_33d6fbe19965f8f4.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/lefto/Theater_hu_4b7e5b363939b98d.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/lefto\\/Theater_hu_9d65aff5998450ed.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Leftovers","tags":"Random","content":"On our flight back to Sydney from Kenya on the weekend, Cherry and I watched a movie called \u0026ldquo;The Day the Earth Stood Still\u0026rdquo; (a remake of a film that first came out decades ago). I was deeply impressed with it in several ways.\nMovies about aliens virtually all focus on the dilemma about whether to treat aliens as enemies or to (perhaps naively) treat them as friends. There are powerful arguments for both approaches. However, \u0026ldquo;The Day the Earth Stood Still\u0026rdquo; is unique in that it shows both aspects in the same people.\nThe aliens are a highly developed species who can see the bigger picture, and who want to save the world. But they also see that it may be necessary to destroy the human race in order to do it. They delay making such a decision for a very long time, but eventually find it necessary to make their move. To me, this is a wonderful picture of one aspect of The Revelation. This loving God comes back to \u0026ldquo;destroy those who destroy the earth\u0026rdquo;, not because he is hateful or cruel, but because it becomes necessary in terms of the bigger picture. The way it was put in TDTESS was something like this: \u0026ldquo;If we leave you humans to go on destroying the earth, you will destroy yourselves in the process; but if we destroy you, we may at least be able to save the earth.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat viewers see in these aliens are restrained, caring people, who also see the need to exercise discipline\u0026hellip; a much better portrayal of life in the real world than what usually comes through with monstrous baddies and lilly white goodies.\nThe movie also dealt (though somewhat superficially) with the questions of whether or not people are capable of change, and if they are, what are the changes that are needed. The movie\u0026rsquo;s credibility, unfortunately, totally falls apart as the producers seek to give the audience the happy ending that they so much crave. But the observation of an alien who had lived on the earth for sixty years while studying our civilisation, is far more believable. He says that he has noted that the human race in general is not willing to change, and that they mankind will go to its grave supporting the status quo rather than make the huge changes that are needed to save the planet.\nIt is amazing that this movie made it to the box office at all; but it seems that one of the compromises (apart from the shallow happy ending) that was needed to get it into the theatres was not to be specific about what the changes are that people need to make. So I will say a little about that here instead:\nAt the moment, about half the world is still lives a very basic lifestyle, often centered around a village economy. It\u0026rsquo;s not luxurious, and they go without many things; but it is doable. Most of what they eat and much of what they use and wear is grown and produced by themselves or by others in their village. This is precisely the kind of lifestyle that would be most effective in virtually eliminating the carbon footprint that is crushing the rest of the world. But this is the kind of \u0026ldquo;inconvenient truth\u0026rdquo; that even people like Al Gore do not want to shove in the faces of an obscenely indulgent world.\nSo we go on telling ourselves that there are cost-free solutions that can be worked out by our governments one day; in the meantime, we can go on living our lives as normal, perhaps using cloth shopping bags instead of plastic ones as our \u0026ldquo;contribution\u0026rdquo; to save the world.\nOf course, anyone with a modicum of sense can see that it\u0026rsquo;s going to take a lot more than that; and yet we cover our eyes and hope that it will all go away.\nOne final positive observation about TDTESS, is that it included what appears to be an obvious reference to The Revelation, when the storyline called for great hordes of metallic locusts that devour metal (and everything else in their paths) as the instrument of the aliens\u0026rsquo; judgment on the world. (See Revelation 9:7-9.) As I observed this metal insect army consuming a whole semi-trailer in just a few seconds, it became clear that this is precisely the kind of change that needs to happen to save both the planet and the human race. We need to learn to live without the trucks, and without the football stadiums, and without the sky scrapers, and a lot more of our modern technology if the world is going to be saved.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s nigh on impossible to get the world to stand still long enough to even consider such options.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/the-fear-of-the-devil/","title":"The Fear of the Devil","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/FearOfDev_hu_13762e121a27ba0d.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/FearOfDev_hu_f1afc9da3fe71852.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/FearOfDev_hu_8fd52015bb8c066e.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/FearOfDev_hu_40b1dd1dbad039ea.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Churches and Theology","tags":"Doctrine, Theology, Fear","content":"Most religions promote fear of the devil.

Obviously, he is going to make sure that what you run away from is exactly what you need to face.\nThe devil uses this strategy to frighten people every time God tries to speak. Notice how the first thing God must say is always, \u0026ldquo;Fear not!\u0026rdquo; Until you can overcome your panic when God speaks, you will never hear the rest of what he has to say.\nBy using this scare technique, Satan has more control over religious people than he has over atheists.\n\u0026ldquo;Perfect love casts out all fear.\u0026rdquo; (1 John 4:18) To conquer fear, remember that it is impossible for the devil to permanently deceive anyone who has chosen to serve God above all else.

Martin Luther knew that, and it is how he overcame the devil.\nAn elephant and a mouse walked together across a bridge. As they walked, the bridge shook from the weight. Fish dove deeper into the water and nearby animals raced for cover.\nWhen they reached the other side, the mouse grinned up at the elephant: \u0026ldquo;Boy! We sure shook that bridge, didn\u0026rsquo;t we?\u0026rdquo; he said.\nWhen you are walking hand in hand with the Lord of the universe, you have nothing to fear. \u0026ldquo;I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me!\u0026rdquo; (Philippians 4:13)\nThe devil and darkness have much in common. They both strike fear into the hearts of people the world over.

We call it the \u0026ldquo;forsake all\u0026rdquo; principle. But it could be described in many other ways.\nThe principle teaches that in all areas of human experience, it pays to let go of our attachment to things, whether they be material possessions, hopes, relationships, fears, or whatever. Someone has summed it up by saying, \u0026ldquo;God saves the very best for those who leave the choices up to him.\u0026rdquo; If we try to manipulate God into conforming to our wishes, we cheat ourselves out of something better that he has for us, if only we had let him manipulate us.\nAny time that we are going through stress, worry, depression, pain, indecision, confusion, anger, or temptation, there is something that we need to let go of; and if we can find it, the negative experience will disappear. It may be letting go of a responsibility that we have created for ourselves, or letting go of a fear, or pride, or our desire for excitement, pleasure, or understanding of a situation. Each time we let go and fall back on God\u0026rsquo;s love, despite the circumstances that surround us, peace results.\nJesus said things like, \u0026ldquo;If you want to be great, learn to be a servant. If you want to save your life, learn to lose it. If you want to be first, learn to be last. If you want to have treasure that can never be taken away, sell all you have and give to the poor. If you want to have houses and land and a big happy family, forsake all these things.\u0026rdquo; He was describing the paradoxical forsake all principle.\nThis principle can become an instinctive part of our lives, so that we can instantly prescribe the treatment for ourselves whenever we are \u0026ldquo;getting out of the Spirit.\u0026rdquo; And to the extent that we are willing to let go, we can live a victorious Christian life.\nMost church people know that, for all their talk about victorious Christian living, no one is really living it; yet everyone secretly conspires not to confess this depressing truth.\nWe have heard many claim that they are an exception to the lukewarm norm, but on close examination they all turn out to be dry wells like those described in 2 Peter 2:17-19.\nYet all of their problems could be solved if they would simply forsake all.\nThe few minor problems that we experience are almost nothing by comparison to the spiritual frustrations of those who try to serve God and money at the same time. And even our few problems can always be traced back to some area of our lives where we are not letting go.\nThe slogan \u0026ldquo;Let go and let God\u0026rdquo; reflects the forsake all principle. But most people are afraid to take it literally. Like Abraham (Genesis 22), God asks them to sacrifice their \u0026ldquo;Isaacs\u0026rdquo; and they try to tell themselves that they have done it \u0026ldquo;in their hearts\u0026rdquo; rather than seriously taking a knife to what must be forsaken.\nThe beauty of taking forsaking all literally is that we don\u0026rsquo;t have to live with question marks about whether or not we are really doing what God wants us to do. If God wants us to have something we have forsaken, he\u0026rsquo;ll \u0026ldquo;resurrect\u0026rdquo; it. If he doesn\u0026rsquo;t, then it\u0026rsquo;s better off dead\u0026hellip; crucified\u0026hellip; forsaken.\nWhy not let go of what you cling to and see if God has something better?\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/the-gift-of-prophesy/","title":"The Gift of Prophesy","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/prophesygift_hu_529800c447ed78f2.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"421\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/prophesygift_hu_72e843a7825a9c59.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/prophesygift_hu_e33d74ecee9dced0.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/prophesygift_hu_b32e3553c2b8fc73.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Endtime and Sex Issues","tags":"Prophesy","content":"Some concerns are more understandable, and more honest, than others. We hope this article will help people question the validity of their concerns and whether something may need to shift in order to grow closer to God and other believers, like us.\n(1) Fears and Excuses\nThere are many reasons to share the truth and many blessings that come from doing so. However, being on the \u0026lsquo;front line\u0026rsquo; sharing our beliefs with others can be quite daunting for many people. This can lead to the creation of a corresponding number of excuses for why not to get out there. Blaming materials (e.g. \u0026ldquo;you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be focusing on prophecy but on something more loving\u0026rdquo;) can be a convenient get-out clause. Honest reflection will highlight if we are being motivated by fear, pride, laziness or some other spirit. We understand that people will come to us with questions and concerns, something each of us have had ourselves. However, we would ask that you give our material a proper go before you decide to write it off. If you think something is important enough to share with others, have you considered producing your own material and handing it out? We are open to ideas that are constructive but we are looking for more than just talk. (2) Bad Press\nAnother concern about prophecy which is more understandable is that it is often associated with \u0026ldquo;kooks\u0026rdquo; and religious fanatics who distort prophecy for selfish gain, often to win converts, make money or induce fear. Each time someone sets a date (e.g. Jesus\u0026rsquo; return) which passes without being fulfilled, more confusion and disillusionment results. This leads people to distance themselves from the subject of prophecy, or avoid it altogether, because they perceive that it is safer to do so. However, we would question how \u0026lsquo;safe\u0026rsquo; this is. Just because prophecy is used insincerely does not stop us from engaging with prophecy sincerely. The solution is not to avoid the subject but to ensure that our motivation for studying it is right. It is wise to ask ourselves whether we want a prophecy to say something, rather than_us_ conform to whatever the prophecy actually is saying.\nWe are concerned that scepticism about prophecy hinders people from seeing how world developments line up with the bigger picture. This causes more deception and the people with the loudest voice dominating the air waves. In addition to this, many false doctrines about prophecy prevail within the church, resulting in the vast majority of people not being sufficiently prepared. Something urgently needs to be done about all this.\n(3) Distortions\nSome cynicism towards the subject of prophecy is due to its focus on things that have not happened. Faith is, \u0026ldquo;the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\u0026rdquo; (Hebrews 11:1) Dealing with the unknown and responding accordingly takes trust\u0026hellip; and many people\u0026rsquo;s trust has been shaken due to the bad press mentioned above. The answer is to ground our trust on something more solid. We do this by lining up everything with the \u0026ldquo;Cornerstone\u0026rdquo; - Jesus and his teachings - making sure we do not isolate verses (\u0026lsquo;proof-text\u0026rsquo;) or take things out of context. If we do this, we can usually discern whether a prophecy is true or false. (Hebrews 4:12)\nThe gift of prophecy can be abused and Jesus warned that false prophets would appear directly before his return doing just this. (Matthew 24:24) While it is wise to question people who have not been tried and tested, we can have more confidence in prophecies Jesus and the early disciples gave us. Over 350 Old Testament prophecies were fulfilled in the New Testament, which means that New Testament prophecies are likely to be fulfilled too! Also, if something is prophesied by an Authority like Jesus, it is wise to consider that he went to the trouble of informing us for our benefit. Finally, just because something has not happened yet does not mean to say that it never will happen. We are living in an age when prophecy and reality are more visibly merging, with the prediction in Revelation 13:16-18 being a good example of this. People who claimed that this prophecy was conjecture have needed to re-examine their position with the arrival of an implantable microchip for humans already used for buying and selling since 2004\u0026hellip; something the prophecy predicted 2000 years ago!\n(4) \u0026ldquo;Doom and Gloom\u0026rdquo;\nMany people wrongly assume that Bible prophecy is all about \u0026ldquo;doom and gloom\u0026rdquo; and that we are filling people\u0026rsquo;s heads with fears and doubts. Notions of death and judgement are challenging but this should not cause us to run away from these realities. Considering death and meeting our Maker can be the point at which we start to truly live. Some people argue that we should not worry about the future and that we should get busy living in the now. This sounds good, with Jesus saying something similar in Matthew 6:34. However, it is wise to question people\u0026rsquo;s motivation for using this argument, especially when it hinders a balanced discussion of prophecy. Often these same people worry a great deal about how they will survive in the present, leading them to enslave themselves by worrying about working for money. Jesus\u0026rsquo; resurrection and return is fundamental to Christianity. If Jesus was resurrected, it means_we_ can be resurrected too. Jesus said: \u0026ldquo;he that loses his life for my sake shall find it.\u0026quot; (Matthew 10:39) Confronting our fear of death, and learning to die to self, is the Christian walk. It is concerning that many professing Christians view talk of the \u0026rsquo;last days\u0026rsquo; as negative. There are challenging aspects to End Time prophecy (e.g. period of Great Tribulation with global catastrophes and widespread persecution of believers). However, there is a saying that: \u0026ldquo;It is always darkest before the dawn.\u0026quot; The \u0026ldquo;dawn\u0026rdquo; - when Jesus returns to defeat evil and establish his Kingdom on Earth - is our greatest hope. (see Revelation 21:3-7)\nThe second coming of Jesus marks the end of all worldly kingdoms that have trampled on people rather than helped them. This is \u0026ldquo;good news\u0026rdquo;, unless we refuse to embrace the revolutionary principles of the Kingdom of Heaven that Jesus taught (like being a servant if we wish to be great). (Matthew 20:26-28) Jesus is coming back to wipe away all tears from the eyes of his servants. If we are not willing to serve God and others, then this is likely to be a tearful moment! Jesus said that he is coming back but also that his Kingdom is within us now. (Luke 17:21) Are many professing Christians frightened of thinking about Jesus\u0026rsquo; return to judge the nations because they do not wish to be judged by his teachings today? (John 12:48) The best form of future preparation is present and continual surrender. Imagining the future can help us in the present, and surrendering to Christ now naturally prepares us for his return. Jesus refers to himself as \u0026ldquo;the beginning and the end\u0026rdquo;. The way to understand the end of all things is to understand the beginning of all things. As we draw closer to the end, circumstances will necessitate a return to the simplicity of the message Christ gave right from the start (cross reference Hebrews 10:25 with Acts 4:32-35, for example). This leads us to the final section below. (5) Where is the \u0026lsquo;Gospel Message\u0026rsquo;?\nSome individuals have expressed concern that we have left out the \u0026lsquo;gospel message\u0026rsquo; from materials we hand out, an assertion we strongly disagree with. For many church-goers, the \u0026lsquo;gospel message\u0026rsquo; is summed up in John 3:16. However, \u0026lsquo;believing in Jesus\u0026rsquo; is much more than simply believing in his death and resurrection; it is doing our best to obey what he taught. (John 14:15)\nIt is deeply concerning that so many professing Christians view prophetic texts, like The Book of Revelation, as being separate from the real \u0026lsquo;gospel message\u0026rsquo;. Worse still, they tend to see everything that Jesus taught in the gospels as being contrary to the \u0026lsquo;gospel message\u0026rsquo; too! The opening of The Revelation says: \u0026ldquo;The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; (Revelation 1:1) The book is for servants of Jesus Christ. The decision to ignore this message, or even go so far as to condemn those of us who share it with others, clearly does not come from the Spirit of Christ but from some other spirit instead. Prophetic teachings of Jesus contained within the four gospels and The Revelation are part of the \u0026lsquo;gospel message\u0026rsquo;. At what point does something contained within the words of Jesus stop being a part of the gospel?! When Jesus said \u0026ldquo;repent and believe the gospel\u0026rdquo; (Mark 1:15), he meant the whole message. If we focus on one teaching to the exclusion of others, or add and subtract from the message, we clearly do not believe the gospel, which places us in a precarious position. (Matthew 5:19; Revelation 22:18-19)\nThe Revelation can be challenging to unravel but this should not stop us from trying. We are given a vital clue as to how to unravel this book (and all prophecy) when the angel says to John: \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.\u0026rdquo; (Revelation 19:10) Put simply, in understanding and following the teachings of Jesus, the mystery and spirit of prophecy is revealed. (For example, a sincere follower of Jesus will take what he said about not being able to serve God and Mammon (Matthew 6:24) and will understand how this fits in with the prophecy about the cashless society (Revelation 13:16-18). The Antichrist uses Mammon to enslave people, whereas Jesus sets us free from working for money, which enables us to refuse the mark of the beast when it becomes impossible to buy and sell without it.)\nJesus said that many of his teachings were given to help prepare us. (John 16:1\u0026amp;4) Jesus also instructs us to love others the way he loves us. (John 13:34) Therefore any talk of \u0026rsquo;love\u0026rsquo; or the \u0026lsquo;gospel message\u0026rsquo; which neglects what we need to do in order to be prepared is not the kind of love that Jesus taught. We are deeply concerned that the public are actively being primed to accept the Antichrist and his deceptions, with much of the church world falling into this category, either being deceived or doing the deceiving. Misconception about the true \u0026lsquo;gospel message\u0026rsquo; plays into this deception. Most Christians are being taught to say \u0026ldquo;Lord, Lord\u0026rdquo; but they are not being taught about Jesus\u0026rsquo; instructions, either in theory or in practice. (Luke 6:46-49) For example, Jesus instructs us to sell our possessions and give the proceeds to the poor (Luke 12:33); to share the message with others (Matthew 28:19-20); and to trust that God will look after us each day. (Matthew 6:25-34) What better preparation is there than this, both for the times in which we live and for service in Jesus\u0026rsquo; Kingdom when he returns?\nOver the years, members of our community have distributed materials focusing on different aspects of the message. More recently, we have felt led to give out material (like our film, \u0026lsquo;The Mark\u0026rsquo;, and the book, \u0026lsquo;Not For Everyone\u0026rsquo;) for two main reasons: (1) They explore developments happening before our eyes in order to help make people aware; and (2) They point to Christ\u0026rsquo;s solution of living-by-faith in order to help people prepare. We continue to witness a serious \u0026lsquo;gap in the market\u0026rsquo;, with many churches preaching about \u0026rsquo;love\u0026rsquo;, forgiveness, the sinner\u0026rsquo;s prayer, health and wealth, signs and wonders etc., but with very few churches teaching people to follow Jesus\u0026rsquo; example, especially when it challenges the status quo. World developments reveal that we are on the threshold of the most challenging period of human history the world will ever see. If we are about to be thrown into a war zone, going into denial is not going to help anyone. What is needed, is clear vision and thorough preparation. More than ever, people need to see love in action as defined by Jesus Christ. This is the true \u0026ldquo;gospel of the kingdom\u0026rdquo; which needs to be preached to every living creature before Jesus returns. (Matthew 24:14)\nConclusion\nWe hope this article has been helpful in working through various doubts and concerns regarding viewing and distributing materials relating to Bible prophecy. As we have shown, the spirit of prophecy and the teachings of Christ are one and the same. Unfortunately, our experience to date has been that few people seem to appreciate this, resulting in a serious lack of spiritual and practical preparation. In recognising this, we hope readers will consider that God may be leading us to get out there with our message to help re-address this problem. Lastly, we hope that some of you will also be inspired to help with this urgent and important mission while there is still time.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/the-golden-thread/","title":"The Golden Thread","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/GThread_hu_2831ac068eae88bb.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/GThread_hu_7d544e08d85004d7.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/GThread_hu_c47523dcff354102.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/GThread_hu_8b2642c1eb001d8f.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Churches and Theology","tags":"Doctrine, Theology, Positive","content":"I had a vision that was very strong and that seemed significant.\nThere was a panorama city-scape before me. Every now and then I saw the glitter of gold. In my dream, I zoomed in on the area. There was a golden thread, or ribbon along a path near a river, that was mostly obscured by trees and shrubs.\nThe golden thread represented truth. Several of us (including myself) were on the path. The thread was being spun before us by God himself, and it was meant to show us the way. We had to concentrate on the thread and ignore distractions, or we would lose our way. It was important to keep following the golden thread.\nOther people, notably preachers, would occasionally get a glimpse of the golden thread. They would instantly receive the truths contained in that portion of the thread which they had seen reflected in the sunlight. However, instead of following the thread to find more truth, they would run off and become famous for the sermons and books that would result from their brief encounter with truth.\nSome of us back on the path faithfully following the thread became a little jealous of these instant success preachers, especially since they had received such a small portion of the overall truth that we had discovered. However, we quickly realised that our jealousy too was a distraction, and we returned to following the golden thread.\nThe lesson seems obvious, and that is that we have a higher calling than just some new doctrine, or gimmick. Our calling is to walk in the light continually.

The difficult part is not telling the story, but the difficult part is the fact that we have always shied away from giving testimonies about miracles, because of what the Bible says about evil people wanting miracles and not being content just less sensational truth. We also know that it can be somewhat discouraging to hear miraculous accounts from other Christians when our own lives seem so unexciting by comparison. We should start by saying that this story is probably one of the top three stories of God\u0026rsquo;s provision over a period of 35 years of Christian service. (Maybe one day we will get around to telling the other two!)\nNevertheless, the Bible does record miracles. The miracle of the Passover was relived annually by Jews, as a reminder of God\u0026rsquo;s protection. And even though Christians are urged to think of the death of Jesus as our guiding light, the miracle of the resurrection is still recorded in scripture, as were many of the other miracles that took place during the ministry of Jesus. So we have decided to officially record at least one of the miraculous events in our history, one which we have, over the years, simply referred to amongst ourselves as \u0026ldquo;The Great Escape\u0026rdquo;.\nWe had been working quietly in a small village (Dookanahally) in the suburbs of Bangalore, India, for nearly two years (from 1984 to 1986). One of the most respected elders of the village had shown special interest in us. He had encouraged his teenage son and daughter to assist us in the social work that we were doing. His interest was that they might learn better English, and possibly be able to travel to Australia at some future date. The family was from a high Hindu caste.\nIn the course of our dealings with the young people, we learned that their uncle was regularly abusing the daughter sexually, and it appeared to be happening with consent from her father. The daughter, whom we will call Ruth, was drawn to what we were teaching, and she accepted a Bible from us, which she would read secretly, using a flashlight under her sheet at night. Nevertheless, her father eventually recognised her strong interest in Christianity, and he became concerned.\nHer 18th birthday was approaching, and when she turned 18, she would be entitled to change her religion, according to Indian law. So the father locked her in her room, and then began negotiations to force a marriage with a Hindu man before her birthday. Ruth escaped about two weeks before she was to turn 18, and she came to us with her story.\nWe were in a dilemma. It is against the law to even seek to convert anyone who is younger than 18 in India. However, there was also the matter of the forced marriage and the incest. We finally offered to pay for a hotel room in the city, where Ruth could hide for two weeks. We instructed her not to leave the room, and we would drop off food parcels for her to live on until after she had turned 18. However, after a week in solitary confinement, Ruth was growing restless, and we were afraid that the hotel staff would make a connection between us and her, and we could be in legal trouble because she still wasn\u0026rsquo;t 18 years old.\nDave\u0026rsquo;s brother, Ron, from the U.S., was visiting us in India at the time, and he said that he had wanted to visit a missionary contact of his in Cochin (several hundred miles south of Bangalore). He suggested that Ruth could come with him to Cochin, where she would not have to hide from view for the last week before she turned 18. A few of us (Ross, Liz and Sue) agreed to go with Ron and Ruth on the bus to Cochin, and they sneaked away from Bangalore early in the week. They planned to return on Ruth\u0026rsquo;s birthday, the following Sunday.\nMeanwhile, Ruth\u0026rsquo;s father was getting desperate. He had assumed from the start that we were linked to his daughter\u0026rsquo;s disappearance, and he had made several attempts to get information from us. We pretended to be ignorant of her whereabouts as well as giving no indication that we knew he was trying to force her into a marriage. We calmly reassured him with talk about young people often running away and then returning a few days later. We had asked Ruth to write a letter the same day that she came to us, saying that she was safe and well, and one of us had travelled to Madras on a train and posted the letter from there, to give him the impression that she had fled to Madras.\nNevertheless, the father assumed that she was hiding somewhere locally. On Friday afternoon, two days before her 18th birthday, he sent a delegation to our two-room hut, asking that Dave and Cherry come to his house for a visit. It is a sign of good breeding in India to be very subtle when arguing or making threats; so he pretended to receive Dave and Cherry graciously.\nThey were offered seats at the back of a table that sat in one corner of the room, and the man\u0026rsquo;s friends took seats on either side to make escape impossible. He then feigned concern for our welfare, by telling us (in the strictest confidence, of course!) that the villagers were planning to stone us to death if his daughter was not returned within two hours. He apologised for the villagers, but said that he would be powerless to stop them. He stressed over and over the seriousness of the situation, and asked for confirmation that we also understood the seriousness. Dave assured him that he had understood the message, while never admitting that we knew anything of Ruth\u0026rsquo;s whereabouts. Dave said that he would relay the message to the rest of the community and that they would do all that they could to locate Ruth.\nOf course, it would have been completely impossible to return Ruth that same day, and it would even be impossible to return her before Sunday, because we had forgotten to get any name or address from Ron before he left. We honestly did not know where he had taken Ruth. Even if we were able to escape from the village ourselves (and we knew that we were being watched by just about everyone), we would not be able to stop Ron, Ross, Liz, Sue, and Ruth from walking back into a very dangerous situation when they returned in two days\u0026rsquo; time. We did not have any way to contact them, and we did not know how they planned to travel on their return trip. (Long distance buses all leave and arrive from independent locations, depending on where the particular bus owner lives.)\nIt was time for a very serious prayer meeting. We had a listening time and several people shared what they had received. Paul said that he had seen a vision of \u0026ldquo;Aladd\u0026rsquo;s lamp\u0026rdquo;. We corrected him, and said that the correct name is \u0026ldquo;Alladin\u0026rdquo;. We wondered whether the lamp (and the genie that lived in it) might represent the Holy Spirit. If so, it could mean that God was saying that he would send along his \u0026ldquo;genie\u0026rdquo; to protect us.\nSomeone else had a vision of some gambling dice. We knew that our chances of escaping, and especially our chances of locating the others in a city of more than a million people were almost nil. However, we felt that the dice was saying that we should \u0026ldquo;take a chance\u0026rdquo; and go for it.\nDave had a vision of a soft lounge, and the strong impression that God was saying for us to relax, and trust that it was all in his hands. Relaxing was the hardest part of all, knowing that we could be less than two hours away from death. However, we devised a plan which would give the impression that we were, in fact, unafraid. The more relaxed we appeared to be, the more confident Ruth\u0026rsquo;s father would be that we were going to produce his daughter in two hours\u0026rsquo; time.\nCherry went through the motions of doing the washing, and hanging it on the clothesline in front of our hut. We had a house full of furniture, plus several tea chests full of clothing and other things that we had planned to distribute to people in the village. We decided to take Liz and Rachel\u0026rsquo;s father, Daniel, into our confidence; so Daniel was sent for, and told about the situation. We gave him the keys to the hut, and said that he could do what he liked with all of our possessions after we left.\nChristine had been giving guitar lessons to a neighbour, so she took the guitar by and said that she wanted to leave it there for the neighbour to practise on (knowing that we would never return, and at least the neighbour would have a guitar of her own). Dave took a suitcase full of clothing to one particularly poor neighbour and presented it to them. Kevin gathered all of our papers together, including a stack of invitations to Robin and Christine\u0026rsquo;s wedding, which had been booked in a local hall the following week, and placed them in a travel bag along with a huge grinding stone. We did not want any information to be left there which could be given to the police or which could be used in tracking us down.\nKevin had shared a dream with us a year or two earlier about throwing a bag into a well, and about the bag floating even though it had a huge stone in it. On arriving at the village, he had spotted the well that he had seen in his dream, and he pointed it out. Now he was living out what he had earlier dreamed. He placed the heavy bag on the seat of a bike and pushed it casually toward the well. He stopped to peer down the well, and then waited until he was sure no one was looking, and pushed the bag in. Sure enough, even with the stone in it, it floated for some time, as water took a while to seep in through the zipper.\nWhen it seemed that we had waited long enough, we decided to see what would happen if we were to run for it. Three of the guys were able to walk casually away from the village, probably because the villagers assumed that they were going to fetch Ruth. In fact, they went to a nearby auto rickshaw stand. Auto rickshaws are three-wheeled motorcycles that can carry up to three passengers each. They did the best they could to explain to the drivers that they would need to drive into the village, load up quickly, and then drive for their lives if chased. We could see the autos driving toward us across an open field. None of the villagers had apparently noticed them coming.\nAnd then something dramatic happened. The skies opened up and torrential rain suddenly poured down on the village. Everyone ran inside their huts to escape the downpour, which was just the break that we needed to race to meet the rickshaws, jump in, and speed away. We kept looking back, but could see no sign of anyone following us.\nOnce we were in downtown Bangalore, we searched for a bus to Cochin, found one, and then eight of us sat across the empty back seat for the overnight journey to Cochin. We soon discovered why the back seat had been left vacant for us. The bus had no springs and the road was extremely rough. So all night long we bounced literally a foot in the air every time we hit a bump. It was impossible for any of us to sleep. Nevertheless, our relief at having escaped the threat of death in the village had us all laughing and rejoicing through much of the night.\nWe had successfully accomplished the first half of our plan. But the most difficult part still lay in front of us, and that was locating the others before they left Cochin on Sunday, to unwittingly return to the angry village.\nShortly after dawn, the bus drove into the outskirts of Cochin. We knew that Ross and Sue had hoped to visit some Passionist brothers while in Cochin, and Dave mistook a symbol on a Catholic Church for a Passionist symbol, and he asked the bus driver to let us off.\nWe stood there on the side of the road, thoroughly drained and exhausted after staying up all night. And then someone pointed to a huge billboard on the opposite side of the road. It showed an assortment of gold trinkets and jewellery, along with the words \u0026ldquo;A. Ladd\u0026rsquo;s Jewellery Bazaar\u0026rdquo;! Paul\u0026rsquo;s mispronunciation of Alladin suddenly came back to us. We did not know what else to make of the sign except confirmation that God\u0026rsquo;s Genie was with us.\nBefore Dave raced back to check out the church, Cherry asked whether the others could have a proper breakfast at the roadside cafe where the bus had pulled up. Dave remembered the vision of a lounge, but said that he did not have enough faith to take so much time off from their mission. \u0026ldquo;Just get some coffee and biscuits (cookies) for now,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;After we have checked a few hotels, then maybe we can take a meal break.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen Dave returned from the church, with instructions on how to find the Passionists, the others shared some more exciting news with him. Each of the tables in the cafe had big black and white dice sitting on them, which were actually ash trays. Once again, more confirmation that God was with us. But still not enough to get Dave to take the third revelation more seriously.\nThey split up, with some people checking on hotels and others checking out the Passionists. They learned that the group had visited the Passionists, but they had left no clues as to where they were staying, and no promise of returning. They also located the hotel that the others had stayed at the night before. But Ron, Ross, Sue, Ruth, and Liz had checked out early that morning, about the same time that the rest of us had arrived at the roadside cafe. There was no indication that Ron and company were going to return to the hotel.\nAll that day, the group searched Cochin. Rachel and Liz had relatives living in a village near Cochin, although they did not know where that was either. Dave, Cherry and Rachel followed information they had received about a foreign music teacher who was headed for a village. His description fitted Ross, who is a music teacher. But when they finally tracked down the lead it was someone else.\nVery late that night (Saturday), the exhausted group of nine met up at a pre-determined hotel to compare notes. They were still a long way from locating the others, and it was almost certain that they would be too late if something did not happen early the next morning, when the others were due to head back to Bangalore.\nAgain, Dave thought about the vision of the lounge, but he still could not bring himself to relax. He, Cherry, and Rachel determined to get up early and check into the hotel where Ron and the others had stayed the previous night, just in case they should return there. The others would race around town trying to locate as many buses as they could which would be heading for Bangalore, and then check each bus to see if our friends were on it.\nThe next morning, as Dave and Cherry were checking into the other hotel, they thought of the airport. We knew that our members did not have enough money to fly back to Bangalore; but we did not know whether Ron might invest in a ticket (especially if he had experienced as rough a trip down as what we had!) Dave rang the airport and asked them to page Ron McKay.\nImagine his shock when Ron appeared on the line a moment later, talking excitedly. \u0026ldquo;Get out of the village!\u0026rdquo; Ron said, or words to that effect. \u0026ldquo;You must leave immediately. You are in great danger.\u0026rdquo; He assumed that he was talking to Dave in Bangalore, not knowing that they were both in the same city and that they were both trying to warn the other.\nIt turned out that the others had been in a prayer meeting of their own, and had felt that God was telling them that there was serious danger in the village, whether Ruth returned or not. Ron (who was the one least known in the village) had bravely volunteered to fly back and try to save the rest of us.\nWe were all relieved to learn that the others were safe. Ron said he would catch a cab back to the hotel and take us to the missionary orphanage where the others were staying. He arrived and we took the bus together to the orphanage.\nWhen we got off the bus, we looked up, and there was the same billboard, advertising \u0026ldquo;A. Ladd\u0026rsquo;s Jewellery Bazaar\u0026rdquo;. We were standing in front of the same roadside cafe where we had stopped for a cup of coffee the previous morning. And the orphanage was only a few blocks away, down some winding side streets.\nIf the group had simply relaxed and had a leisurely breakfast at the cafe the morning before, the others would have literally dropped into their laps. Because after they had checked out of the hotel, Ron, Ross, Sue, Liz, and Ruth had all taken the same bus to the same stop, so that they could move into guest accommodation at the orphanage!\nAnd that is the story of the Great Escape.\nUPDATE: Though we have never dared to return to the village, we have learned through Rachel and Liz\u0026rsquo;s family that Ruth\u0026rsquo;s mother ended up killing her son\u0026rsquo;s wife, and then taking her own life. Indeed, this was a family that did not make idle threats. Ruth\u0026rsquo;s father later had mail contact with Ruth in Australia, in which he told her that she owed it to her family to commit suicide in order to spare the family further shame at her converting to Christianity. Ruth has since left our community.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/the-hollywood-deception/","title":"The Hollywood Scam","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29,

\n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Endtime and Sex Issues","tags":"Sex, Society","content":"The Hollywood Scam It has been about forty years since Hollywood first took the leap into nude sex scenes in movies, and it may be time to look back on how that has influenced our thinking about such things. I am going to argue in this article that many of us have been coyed into believing that there was something right and good about the decision to incorporate nude sex scenes into mass entertainment, when, in fact, it actually exposed (and continues to expose) us as naive suckers.\nI should acknowledge that nudity in itself is not necessarily the dividing line between good and evil when it comes to entertainment. There has always been a tendency for entertainment to pander to the lowest common denominator. Nevertheless, nudity in mainstream cinema has become a turning point in a way that seems to have cheapened sex wherever its influence has spread, and thus altered both human behaviour and how we view ourselves and our bodies.\nA term used much over the years has been \u0026ldquo;gratuitous\u0026rdquo;, but that term is most often used in relation to the violence that comes with so much entertainment these days. Unfortunately, audiences have often been polarised betwen those who oppose the gratuitous violence and those who oppose the gratuitous sex scenes/nudity, when, I believe, our lives have not been enriched by either.\nArt lovers (and those of us who would like to think that we have some measure of art appreciation) have been told that it\u0026rsquo;s all about \u0026ldquo;art\u0026rdquo;, when it is really all about making money by giving the audience what they want. Those of us who oppose censorship have accepted that others can watch what they choose to watch, but we have often been caught in the vortex as well, simply because of the all-pervading influence of the Hollywood hard sell. We want to be able to say that we have seen the latest blockbusters, and so we go along and keep our mouths shut when the smut comes on the screen.\nWhat has, for the most part, made the sexual content of movies different from the many other bad influences and bad role models that sneak into so much entertainment is that the other stuff is acting and special effects, whereas nudity and sex is not. Sure, the sex scenes are often simulated, but when actors strip off and when they start touching one another, they are, of course, doing things that are a very real part of the sex act. Their own marriages have suffered as a result. You and I and those friends and relatives watching the movie with us, would not think of deep kissing, and touching one another there in the room or in the cinema. We have, in essence, invited into our homes, strangers who will take their clothes off in front of us as a form of entertainment, and we have been made to believe that this is reasonable behaviour for adults.\nEven those of us professing to be Christians have tried so hard to convince ourselves and others that we are not prudes, that we have bitten our tongues before speaking out in protest against such ridiculous behaviour. While some have come to believe that sharing a cinema or loungeroom with a number of other people, all of whom are becoming sexually aroused by what they are viewing, is nothing to be ashamed of, others have had to discipline our minds to pretend the sex scenes are not happening, in order to save ourselves the embarrassment of becoming sexually aroused in sync with a group of friends, relatives, or (in the case of public cinemas) perfect strangers who are viewing the same stimulants.\nAt this point I want to challenge the prude label. I am not suggesting that there is anything wrong with becoming sexually aroused. It may even be a matter of conscience as to whether or not it is right to employ someone other than your husband or wife to take their clothes off in order to GET you sexually aroused. Individuals privately masturbating, or couples having sex in the bedroom are a whole different kettle of fish, however, compared to what goes on when we sit the family down in front of the television, or when we walk into a movie theatre with a bunch of strangers.\nAs in the story of The Emperor\u0026rsquo;s New Clothes, we need some simple childlike wake-up call to tell us that \u0026ldquo;The actor has no clothes on.\u0026rdquo; A simple reminder that this is not what the rest of us in the room would do or tolerate in such a public way will reveal to us the truth about the prostitution that we have been cajoled into becoming a part of.\nThere have been attempts to classify movies so that consumers know what they are getting. However, those of us who would rather not have the sexual titillation foisted onto us, are often forced to miss out on some of the best movies that Hollywood has to offer, just because they felt it necessary to sprinkle some nudity or sex into the mix. It seems that they fear losing those members of the audience who want some form of sexual gratification more than they fear losing our patronage. Because we do not speak up (and, indeed, there seem to be few channels left through which we can speak up) Hollywood has come to believe that they will gain more viewers by dumping a flash of bare flesh in a movie like Forest Gump, than if they were to leave it out. This is the predicament in which we find ourselves today.\nI believe that it is too late to reverse the trend. I believe that the human race has been so corrupted that it is never going to go away. We have been almost universally addicted to the tickling influence of Hollywood, and it is making so many billions that the producers are not going to listen to the tiny whisper that might come from even the most militant campaign to change them. So what is needed are strategies that will, despite the intransigence of Hollywood, maintain the dignity of the tiny minority that still has the good sense to question how brainwashed we have become.\nI would suggest that the first step needs to be to stop thinking that we \u0026ldquo;need\u0026rdquo; Hollywood\u0026rsquo;s entertainment. I don\u0026rsquo;t say that we need to stop \u0026ldquo;using\u0026rdquo; entertainment as a form of education or relaxation; but I am saying that we need to be capable of considering boycotts as an option before we can come up with strategies that represent our own control over what we watch.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start by asking ourselves, what would be the impact on our lives if we were to simply stop watching all of the movies that we presently watch? Would we be crippled socially? Would we become depressing sourpusses? Would our intelligence suffer? I\u0026rsquo;m even talking (at this stage) about missing out on some of the great religious epics. Would it stunt our spiritual growth?\nI think that when we find the answers to those questions, it will empower us to take back control of what we do choose to watch on TV or at the cinemas. We can survive (and even flourish) without them. Start by recognising that.\nSomeone has said that Walt Disney made movies that kids were not ashamed to take their parents to. Certainly Walt Disney has shown that entertainment does not have to be promoting immorality or promiscuity to be entertaining. Yet many of us have been conned into thinking that we are not \u0026ldquo;mature\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;adults\u0026rdquo; unless we are watching the \u0026ldquo;hard stuff\u0026rdquo;. We feel incomplete as human beings if we only browse through the children\u0026rsquo;s section of the video shop. Many of us don\u0026rsquo;t go there at all, even though such great classics as Lord of the Rings are often put there and only there.\nClassifications like \u0026ldquo;for mature adults\u0026rdquo; might be more accurate if they used words like \u0026ldquo;offensive\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;suckers\u0026rdquo;, or even \u0026ldquo;depraved\u0026rdquo; to describe the people who would choose them over great movies that have not seen a need to add nudity or sex scenes to the plot.\nThere are so many good movies out there these days, that we should not have to even consider those which show that they have been rated M or R because of the explicit sexual content. Again, there are things like bad language, use of drugs, and violence that may or may not offend others. The classifications are there so that you can decide for yourself before you even think to take the video home. But, in particular, I am talking about real people taking their clothes off and behaving in ways that you would not want or, indeed, even allow anyone else to behave in the presence of those watching the movie with you. It is a pity that so many good actors have stooped to prostituting themselves in this way, in order to make a name for themselves in Hollywood, but at least we can refuse to support such an industry by not inviting them into our homes.\nSome of us have worked on fast-forwarding or covering the screen when the sex scenes come up. But this is an embarrassingly cumbersome and unworkable process, given that most of us don\u0026rsquo;t know ahead of time when the scenes are going to come up, nor how long they are going to last, and given that there are so many other good movies out there that do NOT have such scenes at all. In fact, we seem to be acknowledging, by all the fuss that we go through to hide the sex scenes, that we cannot live without the rest of the movie. I say let\u0026rsquo;s just toss it rather than go to so much effort to do the clean-up job for them.\nI have watched so many movies on planes over the years, which have the sex scenes deleted, that I know there are some great movies out that do not need the sex scenes that have been forced into the plot to entice more viewers. Yet, if the producers insist on putting such stuff in, then in my home, I prefer to cast my consumer vote in favour of those producers who don\u0026rsquo;t think that they need smut to sell their products.\nIf we do find a shortage of good movies because of such a decision, then that may be when we should start to consider other uses for our time: family games, discussions with our friends, time on the porch looking at the stars, a good book, etc. There is so much to do out there in the real world beyond the silver screen.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/the-intuition-myth/","title":"The Intuition

\n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Endtime and Sex Issues","tags":"Men and Women","content":"There is a term that I have heard for many years and just kind of assumed I was missing something when I heard it. The word is intuition. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how it has been used in the past, but I know that I mostly hear it used when comparing males and females. Females are told that they have intuitive skills, or that they think intuitively, whereas men think in some other way, e.g. rationally. Unless I\u0026rsquo;ve missed something, it always seemed to imply two things, both of which I would like to challenge in this article: (1) that intuition is some kind of a skill; and (2) that women have some kind of a special claim on this skill.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with the second one first. If I was to say that men are stronger than women, there would be those who would be quick to point out that there are plenty of women who are stronger than plenty of men. And if I was to suggest, for example, that men are more intelligent than women (and I don\u0026rsquo;t believe they are), then that would raise even more hackles. Intelligence, we would be told, can be measured in many different ways, and if women come up short in any area, it is just as likely that the difference is caused by errors in the testing method or by oppression from men. In other words, they would be saying that men do not have some kind of a special claim on either intelligence or physical strength.\nBut do we as a society take the same attitude toward intuition? Do we say that men are just as capable of intuition as women, and that men have been deprived of the opportunities to develop their intuition? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. It is waved as a banner by many feminists as something that only women have, and that it represents some kind of a fundamental weakness in men.\nNow, believe it or not, this article is not intended as an argument against women\u0026hellip; or even against feminists. It is an article in favour of rational thought. You see, I have recently come to the conclusion that intuition is not a skill at all. It is, instead, a description for a LACK of a skill, which is reasoned thought.\nOne might as well be arguing is that what we need today are LESS intelligent people rather than MORE intelligent people.\nAnd here is where we switch to the first of the two implications I have always associated with talk of intuition, which is that intuition is some kind of a skill.\nHere is the dictionary definition: \u0026ldquo;immediate insight or understanding without conscious reasoning\u0026rdquo;.\nWhat I am assuming is that anyone who has immediate insight or understanding and consciously knows WHY they have that insight or understanding, either lacks intuition, or else has intuition PLUS rational thought (i.e. reasoning). I\u0026rsquo;ll give an example: I\u0026rsquo;m lost in the city, but I have a feeling that I should turn left to get to my destination, and my wife also has that feeling, but she says that the reason she feels we should turn left is because she remembers having passed a certain landmark which is visible on the left when we were trying to find the same place on some previous occasion. One could say that I have intuition, but my wife has something more than intuition. She has a REASON for wanting to turn left.\nNow ask yourself honestly, how many times have you been in a similar situation, and thought that you should turn left (without any conscious reason for thinking that), when you later discovered that you should have turned right? I am confident that if we carried out experiments, we would find that people who have reasons for making such decisions have a better record of being correct than people who operate only on intuition.\nSo is intuition a skill? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. I think it simply identifies a failure to understand why someone feels a certain thing is right; and without a reason, the intuitive person is more likely to make wrong decisions. I also feel that those times when intuition works are often because there IS a reason why the person has that gut feeling, even though they are not aware of it. If they WERE aware of it, of course, they would be better able to decide whether to go with their gut feeling.\nNow notice that I used an illustration where my wife recognised the landmark, whereas I just had a feeling. You see, I\u0026rsquo;m not really talking about a battle between the sexes. I am really talking about a battle between superstition and reason. Whoever it is (male or female) that promotes intuition as being a skill is really working counter to reason. When you don\u0026rsquo;t have anything else to go on, then you have little choice but to \u0026ldquo;trust your intuition\u0026rdquo; or to \u0026ldquo;go with your gut feeling\u0026rdquo;. But rest assured that you will be less likely to make a bad choice if you have something more than intuition to go on. And the more awareness that you can develop, the less you will need to rely on intuition.\nAll of this goes along with our conviction that what is often referred to as \u0026ldquo;male\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;female\u0026rdquo; in the Bible just has to do with qualities that have been traditionally linked to males and females. Feminists who want to claim some special skill for women, on the grounds that women have more intuition, are, I believe, actually putting women down, or trying to mislead them into thinking that intuition is a skill in itself. What both sexes should be doing is trying to understand their intuitive knowledge, so that they can make better use of both sides of their brain. And to do that, we need to accept the fact that insight or understanding WITH conscious reasoning is better than insight or understanding WITHOUT conscious reasoning.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/the-kingdom-of-heaven-or-religion/","title":"The Kingdom of Heaven or Religion","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/KOHOrReli_hu_4be0415cdd6b8d22.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/KOHOrReli_hu_53f90e9bf3ebd22f.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/KOHOrReli_hu_87333dccae9d7e3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/KOHOrReli_hu_28deb22d470a6697.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Top Forty","tags":"The Kingdom of Heaven, Religion","content":"We wanted to know the important differences between the Christian religion and all other religions; between the part of the Bible before Jesus was born, and the part after he was born, between the teachings of Jesus and the teachings of all other religious leaders. We were not interested in the small differences that most people argue about. We asked God to show us the important differences, and he did.\nWhat we learned is that the Christian religion (as Jesus was teaching it) is so different from all other religions that you cannot truly call it a religion. In many ways, the groups that call themselves Christian are more like the other religions than they are like Jesus and his first followers.\nThere are some important ways that almost all religions are the same, and it happens that these things are, at the same time, the things that make them all different from what Jesus was teaching. We will talk about six differences.\nA. Buildings Almost all religions are deeply interested in buildings. They have many special names for their buildings, and in one way or another, they give more time, money, and love to the buildings than they give to God and other people. Different religions often compete with each other to make bigger and better buildings.\nThis strong interest in buildings was a problem from the start, between God and people. The first book of the Bible says that \u0026ldquo;Cain moved away from God\u0026hellip; and made a city.\u0026rdquo; (Genesis 4:16-17) It says that the people of Babylon made God angry with their interest in making a very tall building. (Genesis 11:3-4)\nReligious people want others to love their buildings. (Luke 21:5-6) And they become angry when other people say anything against their buildings, and all the money that they waste on them.\nWhy was Jesus killed? The Bible says that the one reason that the religious leaders agreed on was that he was killed because he was against their building. (Matthew 26:59-61)\nThe building in itself was not bad; but Jesus was against the LOVE that the people had for their building. It was a love that they should have had for God and others, and not for a dead building. Churches today spend about 90% of their money on buildings, and less than 1% to help the poor. The Bible says that where we put our money is where we put our love. (Matthew 6:21)\nWhen Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;It is finished,\u0026rdquo; as he was dying on the cross, he was saying that God is finished with the way of religion. God showed the truth in this by destroying the covering to a special place where the Jewish people believed God lived. He did this at the same time that Jesus died. (Luke 23:45-46)\nJesus had said to a woman before this happened, that a time was coming when it would not be important where people go to pray, but only that they have the right spirit in their hearts when they pray. (John 4:21-24) In the kingdom of heaven you do not go to church, because you are the church (Acts 7:48). The first Christian to die for his faith died a few minutes after saying this to the religious leaders. And religious leaders become very angry when we teach this today.\nThe new part of the Bible is clear about the truth that God lives in the hearts of people now, and not in buildings. (I Corinthians 6:19) This is a very big and important difference between the church that Jesus was making and the buildings that religions all over the world are making to this day.\nB. Health Because religious people love the building more than the God who lives in it, when they hear that God lives in our bodies now, they start to love their bodies too, and to teach that this is what God wants. Again they are showing more love for the \u0026ldquo;container\u0026rdquo; than for the God who lives in it.\nAlmost all religions have teachings about how to be healthy (Mark 7:3-4), and they try to make these rules equal to (or more important than) the really spiritual rules that Jesus was teaching. Health rules about eating meat, drinking alcohol, using sugar, taking drugs, and other things like that have become religious rules.\nThey say that people who follow their rules about health are more spiritual than people who do not follow them. But Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;Nothing that goes into your mouth can make your heart bad.\u0026rdquo; (Mark 7:15) People said that Jesus was an alcoholic and a pig because he was not afraid to drink alcohol and to eat food that the religious people said was bad for him. (Luke 7:34) He said that God can protect us from danger if we eat or drink food or water that is not good for us. (Mark 16:18) Jesus said that Peter should kill and eat animals that his religion said were dirty animals. (Acts 10:9-16) This was because he wanted Peter to live and work with people from other religions, who did not follow the rules of Peter\u0026rsquo;s religion. Health rules can help people to be more healthy; but when religions make them into religious rules, they separate people and make each side believe they are better than the other side.\nMany people with healthy bodies are not humble. They have a sick spirit. They do not have much true love for other people. Healthy people can be cruel to sick people, by saying that the people are sick because they are bad and because God is angry with them.\nGod wants us to have healthy hearts more than he wants us to have healthy bodies. It is not spiritually important if we are sick or crippled. (Matthew 18:8-9) Often a sick person is more humble than a healthy person. (John 9:39-41)\nOne day our bodies will die. (I Corinthians 6:13) Religions that encourage people to pray for God to heal them often teach that the most spiritual people are the healthy people. Healing becomes another force to separate people. But in the kingdom of heaven, we are not looking for perfect physical bodies. (Romans 8:23) We are looking for new spiritual bodies, after our physical bodies die. (I Corinthians 15:50-53)\nC. Special Religious Actions Almost all religions teach people to do special religious actions that the people believe will make them spiritual. There are many different names for these actions. The churches call them \u0026ldquo;sacraments\u0026rdquo;, and the Jewish religion called them \u0026ldquo;sacrifices\u0026rdquo;. But Jesus said that God is not interested in sacrifices (or sacraments). (Hebrews 10:5-6) What God wants is love. (Mark 12:33)\nMost religions teach people to say magic words that they say will give them spiritual strength. (Matthew 6:7) The churches often write out words for people to use when talking to God. This could go against the teaching of Jesus about secret prayers in our hearts, where others cannot hear them. (Matthew 6:6) The words we use are not important. God hears the language of our spirit. (Romans 8:26) If our spirit is wrong, special words will not help. If our spirit is right, special words are not needed.\nMany religions teach people to cut their bodies in some way, to show that they are better than other people. The Bible says that God is not interested in this. All he wants is for people to believe him. (Romans 3:28-30)\nMany Christians tried to make new sacraments to take the place of the Jewish sacraments that followers of Jesus stopped doing. Jesus said that we should cover people with the spirit of truth that is in his teachings, but the early Christians tried to cover people with water, the way Jewish people (like John) often did. (Luke 3:16) Paul started doing that too, thinking that there was magic in the water, but he quickly learned that these actions separate people too. God showed him that he should not be trying to follow the Jewish understanding of sacraments. (I Corinthians 1:17)\nThe actions that God wants people to do in his kingdom are not special religious actions. What he wants is for us to obey his Son, Jesus. (Hebrews 10:7; I Samuel 15:22)\nD. Holy Days and Meetings Almost all religions have special holy days and/or weekly meetings. They have these meetings over and over, because they believe it will make God happy. (Hebrews 10:11) The problem is that the meeting or holy day is only for a short time. When it is finished, people leave the meeting or other holy action and return to living as they lived before the meeting. By the time another holy day comes around, they need to do the same things over again, because it has been too long between meetings.\nThe followers of Jesus lived with him, seven days a week. (Luke 8:1) The Bible says that they \u0026ldquo;showed\u0026rdquo; that the kingdom of heaven had changed their whole way of living. The first Christians lived together seven days a week. (Acts 2:44-45) They were able to use every day to do good. (Acts 5:42) The Bible says that we should not stop living together, the way most people do today. (Hebrews 10:25)\nThe reason for this difference between religion and the kingdom of heaven is because religious leaders do not feed the people who follow them. Religious leaders teach the people to work for money six days a week and to give God one day a week.\nJesus said that people should stop working for money. (John 6:27; Matthew 6:24, 31-33) If we stop working for money, we can work for God. When we work for God, we do not need a special \u0026ldquo;rest\u0026rdquo; day, because our whole life will be filled with the rest that God gives (Matthew 11:28-30) All days will be holy days in the kingdom of heaven.\nThis teaching about God feeding the people who work for him is a teaching that no other religious leader has the faith to teach their followers. It, too, is an important teaching that makes Jesus\u0026rsquo; teachings different from all other teachings in the world.\nE. Leaders and Groups Most religions are very interested in their leaders and in the rules of their group. The rules separate people in one group from people in other groups. Because of this, people from different religions argue, fight, and start wars against each other.\nJesus said that the kingdom of heaven is invisible. (Luke 17:20-21) Being in a group, or not being in a group will not make any difference to people who are in the kingdom of heaven. You join the kingdom of heaven by having faith in God, love for others, wanting to know the truth, and being humble.\nWe find that religious people are more interested in learning the name of our group, the name of our leader, and how our rules are different from their rules. They have a special interest in the differences, because what they really want is a reason to say that we are wrong and that they are right.\nAlmost all religions have special names for their leaders. The names make the leaders proud. Jesus said that we should not use special names (like Father, Mister, or Reverend) for our leaders, because we are all brothers and sisters in God\u0026rsquo;s family. (Matthew 23:2-12)\nF. Studies about God Religions have much to say about God. They say that they understand what God can do and what God cannot do. But in the kingdom of heaven, the most important thing is to find out what God wants us to do, and then to do it. No one (but Jesus) understands all about God. (John 1:18) All God wants us to do is to listen to, believe, and obey his Son - Jesus. (John 6:29)\nReligious people like to ask us questions about things that do not change the way we live. They want to know if we think there is one God or three Gods, what we believe happens to us after we die, what we believe about angels and devils, what we believe about Jesus being a man and God at the same time, and many other things that do not make any difference in the way that we live. If we give the \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; answer to any of these questions, they will use it to say that we are bad and they are good. But Jesus said that he is more interested in finding people who will obey him. (Luke 6:46)\nIn closing, there are other ways that the kingdom of heaven is different from all the religions of the world, but if you study these six ways, they will help you to understand the difference between what Jesus was saying and what the religious leaders of the world are saying.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/the-love-of-selfie/","title":"The Love of Selfie","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/Selfie_hu_8b61d3755221ed84.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/Selfie_hu_4182bda17cc0c96c.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/Selfie_hu_a7dad5ddc91ad785.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/Selfie_hu_70684337339fee8e.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Endtime and Sex Issues","tags":"Vanity","content":"\u0026ldquo;But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: 2 For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,\u0026rdquo; (2 Timothy 3:2)\nVarious passages in the Bible describe specific events people are instructed to watch out for indicating that we are getting closer to the return of Christ. These include natural disasters and significant changes in global politics and economics, but they also include a range of more subtle phenomena, such as that described in the verse from Paul\u0026rsquo;s letter to Timothy above.\nWhen talking to his disciples about the last days, Jesus warned that: \u0026ldquo;because inquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.\u0026quot; (Matthew 24:12). It is easy to see the relationship between the growth of Self-love, as spruiked by the world today, and the reduction in real Godly love, as taught and demonstrated by Christ.\n\u0026lsquo;In Greek Mythology, Narcissus was known for his beauty and for being proud, in that he disdained those who loved him. Nemesis, the spirit of divine retribution against those who succumb to arrogance before the gods, noticed this behaviour and attracted Narcissus to a pool, where he saw his own reflection in the water and fell in love with it, not realising it was merely an image. Unable to leave the beauty of his reflection, Narcissus drowned. Narcissus is the origin of the term \u0026rsquo;narcissism\u0026rsquo;, a fixation with oneself and one\u0026rsquo;s physical appearance.\u0026rsquo; (Wikipedia)\nWe live in an age of transparent obsession with outward appearance and decadence. Our collective psyche has been pervaded with deceitful catchphrases, like that of the \u0026ldquo;beauty\u0026rdquo; label, \u0026lsquo;L\u0026rsquo;Oreal\u0026rsquo;, who market their products by telling us: \u0026ldquo;Because you\u0026rsquo;re worth it!\u0026rdquo; Another recent brand, \u0026lsquo;Urban Decay\u0026rsquo;, sells women a line of \u0026ldquo;beauty\u0026rdquo; products, featuring \u0026ldquo;Perversion\u0026rdquo; mascara and \u0026ldquo;Blackheart\u0026rdquo; Gothic nail polish. The Beast appears to be describing his own image in increasingly honest terms!\nMany forms of Self-love are prostituted in society today, but arguably the most widespread and socially accepted of these is the \u0026ldquo;selfie\u0026rdquo;. Wikipedia defines a selfie as: \u0026lsquo;a self-portrait photograph, typically taken with a digital camera or camera phone held in the hand or supported by a selfie stick. Selfies are often shared on social networking services such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. They are usually flattering and made to appear casual. Most selfies are taken with a camera held at arm\u0026rsquo;s length or pointed at a mirror, rather than by using a self-timer.\u0026rsquo;\nPeople everywhere, from celebrities to politicians, kiddies to grannies, have jumped on the bandwagon of taking individual or group selfies. It is not necessarily wrong to take a photo of oneself, but the culture that is developing around the \u0026ldquo;selfie\u0026rdquo; seems increasingly unhealthy. The extent to which some people are willing to go to obtain and show off one of these, to real and \u0026lsquo;virtual\u0026rsquo; friends alike, is quite unbelievable. With worrying frequency, we hear of yet another poor soul who has been seriously injured or killed in the pursuit of taking a selfie, through climbing on top of a train or hanging off a bridge somewhere. What madness (and sadness) would incite someone to risk their eternal livelihood in order to obtain a temporary snapshot of themselves?\nOscar Wilde\u0026rsquo;s novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, reveals the outcome of a soul when obsession with beauty and sensual fulfilment is taken to a logical extreme. Dorian\u0026rsquo;s outward beauty is captured in a full-length portrait but as he understands that his beauty will fade, he decides to sell his soul in order to ensure that the picture, rather than he, ages and fades. The wish is granted, and Dorian pursues a string of varied, amoral experiences; all the while his portrait ages and records every soul-corrupting sin. The story ends with Dorian attempting to destroy the portrait, the image of his disgustingly corrupted soul, which haunts him like a conscience.\nIf we take a closer look at the lives of the people paid to promote the lie of \u0026ldquo;Self-love\u0026rdquo;, we see just how much of a lie it is. Often these same people\u0026rsquo;s lives are extremely sad, tainted by marital problems, financial woes, drug and alcohol abuse, depression and even suicide. Love of Self leads to a perpetual state of spiritual emptiness because it is impossible to fill that emptiness through obsession with Self, especially when this relates to what we look like or how we come across to others. To any thinking person, the outward form is fickle and changeable, here one minute and gone the next, even if it was applauded and coveted just a few minutes ago.\nWhat people (especially the youth) urgently need to be reminded of, is that so much of the worldly philosophy of Self-love is based on a damnable fallacy. Self-love that is dependent on external ratification and self-projection, as opposed to intrinsic self-worth, is not real love. The \u0026ldquo;Golden Rule\u0026rdquo;, taught by Christ, is that we should treat others the way we wish to be treated ourselves. (Matthew 7:12) This is the only way we obtain self-worth. Without this, our \u0026lsquo;Self-love\u0026rsquo; is fleeting, based on insecurity and, ultimately, self-contempt, which will leave us feeling spiritually malnourished and unfulfilled.\nIn his book, \u0026lsquo;Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing\u0026rsquo;, Soren Kierkegaard wrote: \u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; at each man\u0026rsquo;s birth there comes into being an eternal vocation for him, expressly for him. To be true to himself in relation to this eternal vocation is the highest thing a man can practise, and, as that most profound poet has said: \u0026ldquo;Self-love is not so vile a sin as self-neglecting.\u0026rdquo; Then there is but one fault, one offence: disloyalty to his own self or the denial of his own better self.\u0026quot; In the quote above, Kierkegaard appears to be encouraging the reader to look into a deeper mirror, where we stand before God as an individual with the camera of eternity focused on us. This provides a whole new slant on the self - namely the need to discover the truth about oneself and our reason for existence. Kierkegaard\u0026rsquo;s thought is similar to the Apostle James\u0026rsquo;s reference to the man who beholds his face in a mirror and immediately forgets what manner of man he was. (James 1:23-4) Being true to ourselves is refusing to get caught up in the superficial values of the world. On first glance these values may sound attractive, but it is not long before their ugliness shows through.\nThe Apostle Paul used another mirror analogy in his epistle to the Corinthians. He wrote: \u0026rsquo;\u0026hellip; For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.\u0026rsquo; (1 Corinthians 13:11-12) Mature love has integrity and this integrity inspires the beholder to look deeper than outward appearance: it leads to us not just being a \u0026lsquo;hearer\u0026rsquo; but a \u0026lsquo;doer\u0026rsquo; of truth as well. The \u0026ldquo;knowing and being known\u0026rdquo; also speaks about relationship, between love and action, and the interconnectedness between people, which is the heart of the \u0026ldquo;Golden Rule\u0026rdquo;. If our love isn\u0026rsquo;t shared, then how can it be love?\nIn the Book of Revelation, there is a description of a serpent [the devil] who casts water out of his mouth as a flood in an attempt to drown a woman [the Church]. The earth helps the woman by swallowing up the flood. As a result of this, the devil is very angry with the woman, and goes to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. (Revelation 12:15-17) It is interesting - the similarity between the story of Narcissus, who ends up drowning as a result of listening to a lie - and what is described in The Revelation, where the devil attempts to destroy people with a flood. It seems quite likely that this flood could represent a flood of lies, which includes the lie of Self-love.\nThe devil (aka \u0026ldquo;The Father of lies\u0026rdquo;) knows that his time is short (Revelation 12:12). Between the lines of what we see and hear today in the marketing slogans of the countless false prophets paid by the Beast\u0026rsquo;s system is a demonic strategy to twist us against our selves. It is an attempt to make perdition sound like salvation. Conversely, Jesus and other prophets sent by God throughout the ages, showed that real love for our selves in the eternal sense is to live a life of self-sacrifice in the temporal realm, putting other people\u0026rsquo;s needs above our own (Luke 9:23-5; Philippians 2:3). When we do this, we are filled with a good spirit and we experience the fruit of this, both in this life and the next. In conclusion, being good to our selves means doing good to others - something we would do well to reflect on the next time we find ourselves standing in front of a mirror.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/the-mark-of-the-beast/","title":"The Mark of the Beast","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/MarkofBeast_hu_8f0d4dfe8183edda.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"420\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/MarkofBeast_hu_4026427ff44a65b1.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/MarkofBeast_hu_b647eb75aa090f0d.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/MarkofBeast_hu_fc4345e302094e9d.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Endtime and Sex Issues","tags":"The Mark of the Beast, Prophesy","content":"The last book of the Bible is called The Revelation by Protestants and The Apocalypse by Catholics. It is a poetic description of the battle between good and evil, using numerous symbols and creatures to illustrate its message.\nParts of the book deal specifically with the period near the end of history, when Jesus Christ is supposed to return to earth and fight a great battle with evil, commonly known as The Battle of Armageddon.\nOver the centuries, millions of people have been intrigued by The Revelation, particularly as they have tried to use it to decipher exact dates for when these events will take place. Whole denominations have been formed on the basis of a particular interpretation, most notably Jehovah\u0026rsquo;s Witnesses, Seventh Day Adventists, and Christadelphians. Such denominations have generally been regarded as cults, outside the mainstream of Christianity; and their predictions have almost all proven to be incorrect.\nAs a consequence, The Apocalypse itself has fallen into disrepute. Some priests and ministers openly admonish their congregations not to even read it. Amongst Protestants, doctrines about health and prosperity have replaced talk about the world ending or Jesus literally returning to earth. On the whole, the institutional church is heading into the Twenty-first Century with more concern about the here and now of religious experience than with promises of divine intervention which have been almost 2,000 years in coming.\nYet interest in The Revelation continues, sometimes in the strangest places. Passages which once required faith in a particular theologian\u0026rsquo;s interpretation to be of interest now only require a little knowledge of world events, particularly in the area of computer technology,\nThe Omen trilogy, released in the late 1980\u0026rsquo;s, spawned a number of other films dealing with the subject of a coming world ruler who would be the Son of Satan in much the same way as Jesus Christ is the Son of God. In this decade, rock groups like Iron Maiden have had such hits as The Number of the Beast. The title refers to the number 666, or the \u0026ldquo;mark\u0026rdquo; of this world ruler, mentioned in the 13th chapter of The Revelation. And Stephen King regularly plays with apocalyptic themes in such books as The Stand.\nLike the cults that preceded them, the new gurus of The Revelation continue to exploit fear and to promote superstition. Real answers to the questions that they raise continue to be scarce or non-existent.\nMany passages in The Apocalypse require comparisons with similar passages in the writings of the Hebrew prophet Daniel before they can be understood. An exception is the one relating to the \u0026ldquo;mark\u0026rdquo; mentioned above.\nThe Revelation talks of a Beast being \u0026ldquo;given authority over every tribe, nation, language, and race. All people living on earth will worship it except those whose names were written before the creation of the world in the book of the living.\u0026rdquo; (Revelation 13:7-8, Today\u0026rsquo;s English Version)\nThe passage goes on to say, \u0026ldquo;The beast forced all the people, small and great, rich and poor, slave and free, to have a mark placed on their right hands or on their foreheads. No one could buy or sell unless he had this mark, that is, the beast\u0026rsquo;s name or the number that stands for the name. This calls for wisdom. Whoever is intelligent can work out the meaning of the number of the beast, because the number stands for a man\u0026rsquo;s name. Its number is 666.\u0026rdquo; (Revelation 13:16-18, Today\u0026rsquo;s English Version)\nDuring the Protestant Reformation it became popular to refer to the Pope as the beast, or Antichrist. The official Latin title for the Pope (\u0026ldquo;Vicarivs Filii Dei\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;in the place of God\u0026rdquo;) contains a number of letters which are also used as Roman numerals (V, I, C, L, D). If these are all added up, they total 666.\nIn recent years people have used far more contrived systems for naming any number of world leaders as the Antichrist. Someone devised a system for ascribing numerical values to every letter of the English alphabet and came up with a sum of 666 for Henry Kissinger\u0026rsquo;s name. An even more contrived system was used to make Mikhail Gorbachev the Beast, using the Russian alphabet. Ronald Wilson Reagan was called the Beast just because his first, last, and middle names all had six letters in them!\nBut while attempts to name the Antichrist using the dreaded number 666 have not proven convincing, in recent years attention has turned to the predicted use of the number 666. The Expositor\u0026rsquo;s Bible Commentary, published by Zondervan Publishing House, dismisses attempts to name the Antichrist and emphasises that the number 666 relates to socio-economic control in general and is somehow connected with \u0026ldquo;idolatry and blasphemy\u0026rdquo;.\nWorking on this approach, a number of people have been led to question the growing use of the number 666 in relation to banks and computers.\nPress reports relating to Smartcards and the coming cashless economy often sound like they were taken directly from The Revelation. Through the use of a tiny microchip the size of a grain of rice on Smartcards issued to every citizen on earth, and a huge central computer base, every business transaction on earth could be monitored and recorded. No one would be able to buy or sell without the microchip. And when people have been sufficiently educated in the use of Smartcards, it would be only a short step to remove the microchip from the Smartcard and implant it under the skin of the right hand (or on the forehead if the recipient is missing a right hand). The implant could be achieved painlessly and invisibly, and it would eliminate the problems of lost or stolen credit cards.\nThis week in Sydney, two Christians walked into a branch of the ANZ Bank with barcodes emblazoned on their bald heads and just their presence so infuriated bank staff that police were called and the men were physically removed from the premises. When they returned a short while later they were arrested and charged with trespassing.\nOut on the street other bald accomplices were distributing a short leaflet warning people against moves toward such an economy. Here is what it said:\nAntichrist: \u0026ldquo;The diabolical being opposed to the true Messiah. The End of the World will be heralded by his last desperate attempt to bring about the victory of the powers of evil, but he will be finally vanquished by Christ at the Second Coming. There was a strong belief in the Middle Ages that the Antichrist would arise in Rome. This led the mystic Joachim of Fiore (c. 1130/5-1201/2) to equate him with the Pope.\u0026rdquo; p. 29, Dictionary of Christian Lore and Legend, J.C.J. Metford, Thames \u0026amp; Hudson, 1983.\nBeast of the Apocalypse: \u0026ldquo;One of two beasts\u0026hellip; which symbolise the arch-enemies of the Early Christians. This one \u0026lsquo;bears the number 666, which has given rise to many interpretations.\u0026rdquo;\nAntichrist: \u0026ldquo;The prince of Christ\u0026rsquo;s enemies\u0026hellip; Many see him in the strange beasts of Revelation, sometimes thought to represent Rome, and \u0026rsquo;the man of sin\u0026rsquo; of 2 Thessalonians 2:3-10, who will appear after a great apostasy before \u0026rsquo;the day of the Lord\u0026rsquo; and sit in God\u0026rsquo;s sanctuary, claiming to be God\u0026hellip; Others have connected Antichrist not with a person but with an evil principle\u0026hellip; Yet others have seen in Antichrist a reference to\u0026hellip; Caligula. The attempt of Caligula to set up his statue in the Temple at Jerusalem, and the deification of the Emperor and Emperor-worship, suggested strongly that Antichrist would come from imperial Rome\u0026hellip; Cyril of Jerusalem states that he will be a magician who will take control of the Roman Empire, claim to be Christ, deceive the Jews by pretending to be the Son of David and rebuilding the Temple, and who, after persecuting the Christians, will be slain at the Second Advent by the Son of God. Since the Reformation, the identification of the Pope with Antichrist has been frequently made, especially in the less educated circles of Protestantism. pp. 63-64, The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, 1978.\nThe Expositor\u0026rsquo;s Bible Commentary, Vol. 12, page 533, Zondervan Publishing House, 1984. Revelation 13:18: \u0026ldquo;The Jews used Hebrew alphabetical numbers to indicate concealed names and mysterious connections with other words of the same numerical value\u0026hellip; Thus\u0026hellip; most commentators have understood John\u0026rsquo;s words \u0026lsquo;Let him calculate the number\u0026hellip; His number is 666\u0026rsquo; to be an invitation to the reader\u0026hellip; to discover the identity of the beast\u0026hellip; Irenaeus (second century)\u0026hellip; [believed] the name would be secret till the time of [The Beast\u0026rsquo;s] future appearance in the world.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;In Revelation 15:2 the victors have triumphed over\u0026hellip; the number of his name, which suggests a symbolic significance connected with idolatry and blasphemy rather than victory over a mere puzzle solution of correctly identifying someone\u0026rsquo;s name.\u0026rdquo;\nA growing number of individuals and groups around the world are predicting that the present trend toward the cashless society is an evil conspiracy, aimed at controlling the entire human race.\nTheir explanations, motivations, and solutions vary considerably. But they all agree that what we see happening in the banking world today was predicted in the 13th chapter of The Revelation (the last book of the Bible) nearly 2,000 years ago, and that it is going to lead to disaster.\nOn the whole, these groups represent the lunatic fringe of Christianity. They include groups that are predicting dates for the second coming of Christ as well as groups that are stockpiling weapons in anticipation of a global holocaust.\nBut their basic message (that the cashless society and a one-world government were predicted in the Bible) is gaining acceptance in a wider cross-section of both the church and the secular world. Many individuals are recognising that there is a ring of truth in it even if they do not subscribe to the other beliefs of the groups concerned.\nSo what, exactly, is the prophecy?\nIt is found in The Revelation 13:16-17. The context of the prophecy is that an alliance of nations will eventually rule the world. One leader will gain control of that body. He will have widespread support, and his policies will result in peace and prosperity for much of the human race.\nHe will succeed in getting the whole world to take a mark in their right hand or on their forehead, without which they will not be able to buy or sell. When he has total control of the world economy, he will elevate himself to the status of a god, and he will begin a massive slaughter of anyone who refuses to worship him. More people will be killed in this purge than at any previous time in earth\u0026rsquo;s history. (Matthew 24:21-22)\nThis ruler is called The Beast. He is no mere human. He is the Son of the Devil in much the same way that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. The Bible warns that anyone who takes the \u0026ldquo;mark\u0026rdquo; of the Beast will receive the full strength of God\u0026rsquo;s wrath. (Revelation 14:9-11)\nIt is tempting when writing about the Mark of the Beast, to make predictions with regard to the present worldwide move toward the cashless society. There is almost certainly a connection between the two.\nBut we are not really \u0026ldquo;prophesying\u0026rdquo; when we do that, so much as we are \u0026ldquo;interpreting\u0026rdquo; prophecy in the light of the daily newspaper. And when we make a mistake or exaggerate, or assume things are going to move along more rapidly than they actually do, it all gets used against us, and the result is that the original prophecy loses credibility.\nIf a prophecy is genuine, it should become overwhelmingly clear as it actually comes to pass. Prior to that time, there may be a great many clues or \u0026ldquo;signs of the times\u0026rdquo;. But none of these clues is conclusive in itself.\nThe computer barcode, for example, which now appears on almost everything that you buy at the shop, features three pairs of lines (at each end and in the middle) which are slightly longer than the other lines. These three pairs of lines are the same on all products which use that particular system, and the most popular system uses the line symbols for the number six in each of these three places, giving rise to the suggestion that this is the notorious \u0026ldquo;666\u0026rdquo; mentioned in Revelation 13:18 as the \u0026ldquo;number of the Beast\u0026rdquo;. But if the 666 pattern was dropped from the barcode system, it would not make the prophecy false. It would only make that interpretation incorrect.\nThe original bankcard symbol was three sixes (one red, one orange, and one yellow) inside each other. But that has given way to other cards which do not appear to use sixes.\nI personally suffered embarrassment several years ago when I printed an article based on a report in the March, 1984, Australian Bank Employees News Bulletin, which said that an experiment had begun in Sweden involving special marks on the hand or forehead of 6,000 people. The report said that the mark would be used for all business transactions made by those people.\nWhen I contacted the Bank Employees Union about it after my article came out, I was told that the article in their newsletter had been an April Fool\u0026rsquo;s joke.\nYet the nagging question under all of this is why the banks (or the bank employees) feel it is necessary to pull such pranks or to keep using the forbidden number 666. Is it all part of a plan to mix ridicule with schemes to test the public\u0026rsquo;s reaction to such an idea?\nWhat sounded like a joke in 1984 is being treated much more seriously by the banks, the media, and the public in 1996; yet those who predicted it are still being depicted as deluded fanatics with wild imaginations. This does not seem fair.\nThe world has made a big fuss over prophecies of people like Nostradamus and Jeanne Dixon, who have been wrong in their predictions far more often than they have been correct. But here is a very clear and objective prophecy which has been understood and anticipated for almost 2,000 years. It is very close to coming true in our own lifetime. It carries with it some powerful warnings for the entire human race. So why shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we be doing some serious talking about what it could mean for us as a race and as individuals if we overlook the warnings associated with the prophecy. That is all that I ask.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/the-reason/","title":"The Reason","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/TheReason_hu_af318b31d1dfe21b.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/TheReason_hu_bbae765ab6f0287e.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/TheReason_hu_134075a92901fb85.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/TheReason_hu_8c305ca9e2001464.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Strong Meat","tags":"Hard Truth, Inspirational","content":"_It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household? Matthew 10:25\n_\nIt is becoming harder and harder for us to convince people that we are just another (safe) religious group. Sooner or later they hear that there is a lot of nasty stuff being said about us, and with google being so handy these days, the question comes sooner rather than later: i.e. \u0026ldquo;Why is everyone saying such nasty stuff about you?\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think I have ever had the confidence to say it in an interview when questioned on the topic, but my honest belief is that the reason we receive so much unwarranted opposition is definitely because of our decision to follow Jesus. Hopefully, I will be more confident about saying so in future. (Maybe we should just call ourselves \u0026ldquo;The Jesus Cult\u0026rdquo; and be done with it!) Of course, one has to be very confident that we have not done something to actually deserve the opposition before we can claim to be suffering directly because of our commitment to Jesus. Nevertheless, Jesus was clear about it. While there are other reasons for being persecuted besides the fact that we are following him, if we do follow Jesus, he himself guarantees that it will bring persecution. So much of the banter back and forth between ourselves and our critics avoids this reality, yet it looms like the unacknowledged elephant in the room. Obviously we have decided to follow Jesus, and we have done so in a way that is rarely even thought of in all those churches who would claim to be doing the same thing. We have taken his teachings and attempted to literally practice them in our daily lives. It\u0026rsquo;s not just theology, religious rituals, wishful thinking, and emotional experiences. It\u0026rsquo;s about obedience to the actual teachings of Jesus\u0026hellip; being willing to lay our lives down daily in service to God and others; forsaking all that we own; taking no thought for food or clothing; ceasing to labour for the meat that perishes; going into all the world to preach this good news of faith, hope, and love; and teaching others to observe whatever he has commanded us to do.\nIt has infuriated the whole world in a way that goes far beyond anything that we could ever have actually done to deserve it. Even our own relatives have turned on us, denouncing us as evil. The media and the police have rallied behind a family which tried to kill one of our members, making heroes of that family. Others have rallied behind another relative who has created a website dedicated specifically to destroying us as a community. While people come to us saying, \u0026ldquo;Surely, they can\u0026rsquo;t all be wrong; you must have done something to cause so much animosity against yourselves,\u0026rdquo; I just think to myself, \u0026ldquo;If they can\u0026rsquo;t see it, would it really do any good for me to tell them the obvious?\u0026rdquo; The opposition one receives for obeying Jesus is simply incomprehensible to those who have never tried obeying him. But more than that, it infuriates them just to hear about it. All the world hates a martyr\u0026hellip; so much so that they would be prepared to kill anyone courting such a fate. Ironic, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Between those who oppose us, there is a silent conspiracy to not mention our commitment to the teachings of Jesus when speaking out against us, or, more recently, to actually proclaim loudly that we totally contradict everything that Jesus ever said. What they have found is that the more extreme the lie is, the less likely people are to actually check it out. If we are described as being worse than mass murderers and serial rapists; if we are called kidnappers, paedophiles and killers for Christ; if we are called monsters for whom the world will rejoice when we are dead, then the average person thinks, \u0026ldquo;Gosh, they must have done something bad, even if their critics are exaggerating it a bit.\u0026rdquo; No one considers that the critics may actually be saying such things because we did something good.\nAnd if they convince themselves and others that we are so totally contrary to everything that Jesus taught, that they would be doing God a service by having us incarcerated or incinerated, then who would believe that it\u0026rsquo;s really because we are such dedicated servants of Christ that they have reached this conclusion?\nOne Quaker put it succinctly when observing the ravings of that august assembly against ourselves: \u0026ldquo;You have simply out-quakered the Quakers, and they don\u0026rsquo;t like it.\u0026rdquo; We have taken Christianity out of the dusty old textbooks and decided to actually live it, and that is seriously dangerous. Jesus was called a devil because of the things that he said and did. His opponents convinced themselves that he was going to destroy their Temple, overthrow the government, and trash their religion. He was the spotless Son of God, yet they had the audacity to say that he was demon-possessed. Even when he was healing people, there were those who were saying that he did it with help from the devil himself.\nThe average church goer, with their obsessions about respectability and orthodoxy, could not even begin to grasp how the goodness of Jesus would result in the worst possible accusations being levelled against him. After all, they go to church; they say their prayers; they read the Bible, and no one is calling for their execution. But how much does any of that \u0026ndash; religious as it may be \u0026ndash; actually resemble the life and teachings of Jesus? Until we learn to accept that \u0026ldquo;All who would choose to live godly lives in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution,\u0026rdquo; (2 Timothy 3:12 ) we will be ever running away from the very things that would draw us closer to the Jesus of the Bible. We are a community of people who have decided to really follow Jesus (as in obey what he taught), and we accept that there are going to be serious obstacles thrown in our way. Are we going to turn back? Or are we going to accept fanatical opposition as part and parcel of what our Master promised? The opposition against ourselves is growing. Those who oppose us boast of their growing numbers. Even those who claim to disagree with the murder attempt on one of our members say that we should just overlook it, that we\u0026rsquo;ve done worse things ourselves, that it was all an expression of love on the part of the poor misguided individuals who did it (despite the fact that the would-be murderers appear to be plotting new ways to finish what they started). I have probably not said much that is new in this article. However, I think it is a message which will need to be repeated over and over in the years ahead. We are heading toward what the Bible calls the worst period in the history of the Planet\u0026hellip; a time when persecution will reach unprecedented proportions. It\u0026rsquo;s going to get worse before it gets better. I have said that before, and the opposition has grown. It will need to be said again, as the persecution grows even more. While they rejoice at their apparent successes, Jesus tells us to rejoice that it is all part of his bigger Plan. The more we can accept that this is going to happen, the less distracted we will become as we seek to faithfully labour for God in a world that has gone horribly astray. "},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/the-revolution/","title":"The Revolution","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/FerrisWheel_hu_dba57efe9421f309.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/FerrisWheel_hu_b2e4238bf33a4bdd.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/FerrisWheel_hu_295676120d15d2fb.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/FerrisWheel_hu_3ad86b2229cd8707.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Inspirational","tags":"The Teachings of Jesus, Jesus","content":"This is a Bible study.\nPlease look up the verses.\nA time will come when God will lift up the poor, sad, and weak (Luke 6:20-23), and put down the rich, comfortable and strong. (Luke 6:24-26, and Luke 3:5)\nSome people fight against this revolution all their lives. They are rich and powerful because they take more than they need from the poor. God will eventually put them down. Others have suffered due to the greed of the rich. They will be surprised when God blesses them forever by lifting them up. (Luke 16:25-26)\nTurning things around like this is called a \u0026lsquo;revolution\u0026rsquo;. Jesus did this by telling the poor the good news that God would provide their needs if they shared their possessions and their lives with one another instead of competing for things. (Luke 4:18, Luke 7:22) Of course this was bad news to the rich, who had no intention of sharing their wealth with the poor. (Luke 16:14)\nThe word \u0026lsquo;repentance\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;revolution\u0026rsquo; both mean \u0026rsquo;turning around\u0026rsquo;. Jesus wants us to tell people to turn around. (Luke 24:47) So how do we do this? One revolution is to stop working for money and to start working for love. (Luke 5:10-11, Luke 5:27-28) But there are others.\nWhen we start following the teachings of Jesus, our lives become one big revolution. We give up all that we have and are, and we become poor. We learn to be content with whatever God chooses to give us. (Luke 12:33, Luke 14:33)\nThis step down from being rich to being poor, from honour to humility, and even from working to resting is contrary to the values of our society.\nBut it is the first step in a cycle. It is a downward/humbling/disciplining movement.\nIf life was all discipline and suffering, it would be easy to give up in despair; but we\u0026rsquo;ve found that when we do what we can to trust and serve God, he soon turns it all around. (Romans 8:28) We have a reason to live now, and healthier relationships with God and others. (Luke 9:23-24, Luke 17:33, Luke 18:29-30)\nThis is the upward movement (or blessing) of the cycle. (See illustration on the previous page.) This is why we often say that God\u0026rsquo;s way up is down. Each time of testing is followed (sooner or later) by a time of blessing.\nOf course, each time God blesses us, there is a temptation not to give him credit; and each time he humbles us, there is a temptation to rebel against him or to give up. But if we stay faithful, this up and down movement becomes like the movement of a wheel. As it revolves it makes progress, and with each new revolution that we survive, there will be new growth in each of us.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/the-slippery-slope/","title":"The Slippery Slope","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/SlipSlope_hu_354efaecb7148571.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/SlipSlope_hu_395c2dfd3e074b1d.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/SlipSlope_hu_b53e4a3b39da0d93.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/SlipSlope_hu_cc8a12f8ae31a195.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Inspirational","tags":"Guidance","content":"We had a discussion last night and Jeremy rightly said, \u0026ldquo;I can see an article coming from this.\u0026rdquo; We were discussing the concept of a \u0026ldquo;slippery slope\u0026rdquo; in our Christian walk, and we came up with a number of interesting observations. The argument I am referring to is the one that says a certain action or teaching is likely to lead to much worse actions.\nFor one thing, we concluded that everyone is on a slippery slope. Life itself is a slippery slope. But either we are walking up the slope (i.e. in search of truth and the kingdom of heaven), or we are walking down the slope (i.e. in support of self and the system and its various smaller component systems). People on the mountain will often pass one another, at which point they will more or less be doing the same thing; but for the one walking up the slope, the slippery slope argument will not apply.\nLet me give an example. Two people work hard to clean up their neighbour\u0026rsquo;s yard. One person is doing it out of love, and the other is doing it because they need (or want) some money in return for what they are doing. For the person whose motive is money, who has not learned to question where that motive can take them, there are likely to be other less noble jobs which could end up taking their time. The money-making motive is one that tends to lead down the mountain rather than up it. And if the neighbour refused to pay, this person\u0026rsquo;s attitude toward the neighbour could very easily become less helpful than the yardwork itself. The one working for free, however, is not really in danger of such errors because their motive is fundamentally different. When they finish that job, they will just move on to finding other ways to be helpful.\nHere is another example of something slightly less innocent looking. Two people are speeding down the highway. One is just in a hurry to get to work (or somewhere else) and ignores the speed limit signs. The other is racing to get someone to the hospital. Speeding on the highway is a slippery slope for the person who lets impatience become an excuse for doing so, as they are almost always going to find reasons for wanting to get somewhere more quickly. The other person is just trying to help someone in what constitutes a genuine emergency. When the crisis is past, they will almost certainly return to safer driving.\nSomething else we observed is that we need to chart the behaviour of people and groups to determine whether or not there is a serious danger of them slipping down the slope. There is a difference between being on the mountain (which is covered with slopes) and actually sliding down the mountain. Life is full of risks, but the answer is not to hole up in a cave somewhere. So if someone is heading in the wrong direction, they will actually do wrong things and these wrong things will gradually get worse. We will be able to trace the growth of those wrong things.\nCritics can point to virtually any group and any individual and issue warnings about virtually anything they do, and how it could lead to worse behaviours. But if no hard evidence is presented that they are actually doing bad things, then it\u0026rsquo;s all spurious. Our community, for example, has existed for about 30 years. In that time, we must surely have done some pretty awful things if we are really a dangerous cult. But if, after thirty years of existence, our critics are only warning people about what our behaviour could lead to, it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty sure bet that they are abusing the slippery slope argument.\nI think of Liesel Appel saying on national television in England, something like this, \u0026ldquo;If they are giving kidneys today, what will it be tomorrow? Will they be donating their other organs?\u0026rdquo; The way she worded it, of course, was that everyone in the Jesus Christians who has donated organs has done so under instructions from me, which, of course, is totally false. There is abundant evidence to the contrary. So she created a slippery slope that was, in itself, built on a lie. And this is evidence of the real slippery slope that she herself had stepped onto when she started to tell herself that she could lie about us and it was okay if it helped her to achieve her goal of destroying us. Both her ends and her means were evil, and so she could only become more and more dishonest while she continued to move in that direction. Her attacks on us have been consistently riddled with such lies, and it does not take much effort on our part to point them out.\nMuch is made of the fact that two of our members (Fran and Kim) admitted to telling a lie in order to be able to save someone\u0026rsquo;s life. (They each pretended to have known someone for a long time in order to be allowed to donate a kidney to them.) But did it lead to them telling more lies? No. And as soon as they were able to tell the truth about that one lie, they did so. Thus, no slippery slope. Charting their behaviour showed that it was a one-off event, done for a higher motive.\nWe Jesus Christians have done a lot of things that are controversial and that are out of the ordinary. But if you examine any one of them, you will see that our criteria for what we have done has always involved doing good, helping others, spreading the truth, getting people to think deeply about serious issues. It\u0026rsquo;s all part of a serious climb up the mountain, and so the extraordinary actions have not led to a series of bad decisions. If, as people say, our goal was just some narcissistic obsession with getting publicity, then along the way there would have been a lot of stupid stunts attempted purely and simply for the sake of attracting attention. That has not been the case.\nHowever, after having said all of that, a final observation was that, because we are all on the side of a mountain, there is always the potential to turn around and head in the wrong direction, in which case, almost anything can be abused and used for the wrong purpose. What we need to keep examining is our motives and our goals. One of the most common areas where that turnaround can take place is in relation to promoting our own \u0026ldquo;system\u0026rdquo;. We need to stay vigilant, always questioning our own sincerity by looking for signs that we have strayed away from our professed ideals. Early signs of backsliding (which is really just another name for stepping onto a slippery slope) may be a focus on defending the group, a focus on making money, a focus on fear of the devil, or a focus on political solutions. There are so many directions where such turnarounds can come from.\nSo we have finished up where we started. All of life is a slippery slope. What matters most is not that we avoid risk, but rather that we keep on trying to reach the top. Even when we do make little slips, we can pick ourselves up and lift our eyes heavenward once again.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t stop till you reach the top!\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/the-spirit-of-christ/","title":"The Spirit of Christ","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/Spirit_hu_7d6ac2f9ac0d1678.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/Spirit_hu_3e13e1e3f7f4a3c2.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/Spirit_hu_6ffd891d7fbe9202.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/Spirit_hu_518a03d9dd8e9c6d.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Jesus and Money","tags":"Doctrine","content":"Christian tradition has tended to exaggerate the distinction between the Son of God and God\u0026rsquo;s Holy Spirit.\nWhen Jesus was baptised by John, the Bible says the Holy Spirit came down on him in a bodily form, like a dove. (Luke 3:22) It further says that God did not just give a \u0026ldquo;measure\u0026rdquo; of the Holy Spirit to Jesus (as he does to each of us), but rather that Jesus had the \u0026ldquo;fullness\u0026rdquo; of God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit. (John 3:34)\nWe understand this to mean that there was no division between Jesus\u0026rsquo; own spirit and God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit (like there is with us). His spirit and God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit were one and the same.\nSo the Holy Spirit was not invented on the Day of Pentecost. The disciples had been touched by the Holy Spirit throughout their time with Jesus. Receiving the Holy Spirit and receiving the spirit of Jesus are pretty much the same thing.\nSo what is the link between the spirit of Christ and what happened on the Day of Pentecost, i.e. on the day when the disciples were said to be \u0026ldquo;filled\u0026rdquo; with the Holy Spirit?\nA clue can be found in John 6:63, where Jesus said, \u0026ldquo;The words that I speak to you are Spirit and they are life.\u0026rdquo; Or as the Today\u0026rsquo;s English Version puts it: \u0026ldquo;The words that I have spoken to you bring God\u0026rsquo;s life-giving Spirit.\u0026rdquo; In another place Jesus said that the Holy Spirit would bring his teachings to our remembrance. (John 14:26) So the teachings bring the Spirit and the Spirit brings the teachings. They are intricately interlinked.\nThe Day of Pentecost was the climax of 3 1/2 years of soaking in the teachings of Jesus. The disciples, and most of Jerusalem, had been saturated with his teachings. The religious hierarchy had, in fact, heard enough of what Jesus taught to make them kill him just to try and shut him up. At Pentecost the \u0026ldquo;body\u0026rdquo; of Jesus was gone, but his followers moved on in the power of his \u0026ldquo;spirit\u0026rdquo;.\nPeter says that we are \u0026ldquo;born again\u0026rdquo; by the Word of God. (1 Peter 1:23) John 1:11-12 says that we receive power to become God\u0026rsquo;s children only by receiving Jesus in a way that his own people did not receive him. His \u0026ldquo;own people\u0026rdquo; had no problem with Jesus the miracle worker, as long as he kept his mouth shut; but they could not accept his teachings. And the situation is not much different today.\nIf the church insists on preaching religious experiences without giving people the teachings of Jesus, then you can be sure that the experiences that they offer will be a counterfeit. Only the words that Jesus spoke can bring God\u0026rsquo;s life-giving Spirit. It was the teachings of Jesus which precipitated Pentecost.\nWe have found that those who start with the assumption that the Holy Spirit is something quite separate from Jesus (i.e. primarily an \u0026ldquo;experience\u0026rdquo;) are amongst the strongest opponents of his teachings. They generate doctrines which make Jesus the Teacher the enemy of God the Holy Spirit. And yet Jesus said that the Holy Spirit would \u0026ldquo;bring to your remembrance all things whatsoever I have said unto you.\u0026rdquo; (John 14:26)\nIf your faith is in an experience, you will end up denying the words of Jesus. If your faith is in the words of Jesus, you will still receive experiences (when and as God chooses), but with or without the experiences, you will have God\u0026rsquo;s true Holy Spirit\u0026hellip; and that is what really matters.\nExperiences are subjective, and they must therefore be subject to the teachings of Jesus, which should be our true (objective) source of guidance.\nJesus breathed on the disciples sometime before the Day of Pentecost, and he said, \u0026ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit!\u0026rdquo; (John 20:22) But even before that, they were receiving his spirit, inasmuch as they were receiving his teachings. Even if we did not have verses like John 6:63 to tell us this, common sense should tell us. It is impossible to know the \u0026ldquo;spirit\u0026rdquo; of a person without reference to what that person has said.\nThe word \u0026ldquo;spirit\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;breath\u0026rdquo;. Breath and words both come from the mouth. You cannot speak without breathing. In Revelation 19:13-15, Jesus is called the \u0026ldquo;Word of God\u0026rdquo; and a sword comes out of his mouth. In Ephesians 6:17 this is called \u0026ldquo;the sword of the Spirit\u0026rdquo;. Jesus, the Spirit of God, the Word of God and the teachings of Jesus are all interchangeable.\nYou find the spirit of a law by studying the words, in an effort to grasp the essence of what they are communicating. Sure, people can distort the law by focusing on one \u0026ldquo;letter\u0026rdquo; over another. But it does not mean that we should not try to grasp the \u0026ldquo;spirit\u0026rdquo; of the law, by looking for the \u0026ldquo;sincere milk of the word\u0026rdquo;. (1 Peter 2:2) And you will find the true Spirit of Christ by studying his teachings. Jesus himself said that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. (Matthew 12:34) In other words, the spirit (or heart) that is in us will come out through what we say. The Spirit of Christ also came out through what he said.\nIf you wanted someone to get the spirit of what you were saying, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you rather have them humbly listen to you than to have them go off in a room and tickle themselves with a feather while saying your name, in an attempt to obtain an experience?\nObviously, the essence of what you are (your personality, your authority, your credibility, your spirit, or whatever you want to call it) could best be discovered by listening to what you say.\nYour flesh proves nothing; it is your spirit that is important, and the words that you speak are your spirit. The same is true of Jesus.

And it is taught more universally than any other so-called Christian doctrine.\nThe world would have never known Paul made tents were it not for one verse in the Book of Acts. Though the Bible says Peter, Andrew, James, and John all forsook their fishing businesses when they followed Jesus (Matthew 4:18-22), and Matthew stopped collecting taxes (Luke 5:28), the tent-making myth says Paul never stopped making tents, and it would have been wrong if he had.\nMinisters who live off the donations of their flock invoke the tentmaking argument against anyone else in their church who shows signs of trusting God to supply their needs as they attempt to preach the gospel. The professional ministers argue that they never did anything so reckless as to trust God for their support. They attended the denomination\u0026rsquo;s Bible school or seminary, then thrashed out legal terms of employment which guaranteed that they would never go without. True, they don\u0026rsquo;t make tents; but they leave no doubt in the minds of their congregation that they are working for the wage and not for love\u0026hellip; which is what the tentmaking cornerstone is really about anyway.\nIf Paul had spent his whole life making tents (and one wonders how he managed all his missionary journeys if he was busy running a tent company), would it really prove the other disciples were wrong? And would it make Christ\u0026rsquo;s teachings about taking no thought for food or clothing (Matthew 6:19-34), going into all the world preaching the gospel (Mark 16:15), forsaking all (Luke 14:33), and not working for food (John 6:27) heretical? If so, then we must assume Paul alone has the words of eternal life, and Jesus is a fraud. And that is exactly what the tentmaking myth tries to say.\nIn fact, it goes further than that. It even says that if Paul contradicts it, he is a fraud. See, Paul says (1 Corinthians 7:21-23) that any slave who has the opportunity to be free should use it. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t let God\u0026rsquo;s free people become anyone\u0026rsquo;s slave,\u0026rdquo; he says. Referring to God\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to provide for the needs of his servants, Paul says, \u0026ldquo;No one who joins an army pays his own wage.\u0026rdquo; (1 Corinthians 9:7) He says it is only fair that those who feed the world spiritually be fed in return. (1 Corinthians 9:9-14)\nSo where did the tentmaking myth come from? It came from a short time in Paul\u0026rsquo;s life when he backslid. \u0026ldquo;Backslid?!\u0026rdquo; gasp worshippers of Paul in horror. Yes, great as he was, Paul was fallible. He made mistakes like the rest of us mortals. And he never wanted us to follow him in areas where he strayed from the gospel of Christ. (Galatians 1:8)\n\u0026lsquo;Backsliding\u0026rsquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t always mean a turn-around from loving Christ to hating him. It can be a momentary lapse of concentration, during which we substitute our human reasoning for the clear directions that God has given us. That is what happened to Paul.\nHere is the true story of what happened: Paul arrived in Corinth on his own. (Acts 18:1) He usually travelled with at least one other Christian (as Jesus commanded\u0026ndash;Luke 10:1), but this time he was on his own. He met some prospective converts (Acts 18:2) who offered him a job in their tent company, and he accepted. (v. 3) He still preached on weekends (v. 4), but the rest of the time he apparently witnessed \u0026lsquo;on the job\u0026rsquo; to Aquila and Priscilla. When Silas and Timothy arrived some time later, Paul was \u0026ldquo;pricked in his conscience\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;gave his whole time to preaching the message\u0026rdquo; (TEV, v. 5) Paul later writes to the church at Corinth (with whom he had more problems than any other church he started) and says, \u0026ldquo;The only way I treated you differently from any other church was that I didn\u0026rsquo;t rely on you to support me. Forgive me this wrong.\u0026rdquo; (2 Corinthians 12:13)\nThis is the whole story of Paul\u0026rsquo;s tent-making. But the myth (like all myths) adapts other facts to suit itself. So every time Paul mentions \u0026lsquo;work\u0026rsquo;, the myth inserts \u0026ldquo;for money\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;making tents\u0026rdquo; into the passage. In 1 Thessalonians 2:9 Paul says that he worked night and day preaching so that no one could charge him with failing to do his job. The tentmakers rephrase it thus: \u0026ldquo;I worked making tents during the day so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to charge admission to my meetings at night.\u0026rdquo; Then, when Paul writes to them again (2 Thessalonians 3:7-12) saying not to let lazy people who refuse to work for God live and eat in their communes, the tentmakers change it to say, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t let anyone attend your meetings who isn\u0026rsquo;t spending the rest of their time working for money from the system.\u0026rdquo;\nNote: You may need to check older translations of these passages to get one that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been altered to support the tentmaking bias. This is because churches today no longer live and eat together. They cannot imagine a situation where everyone in a community is working for love, and God is feeding them; so their cultural bias has reflected itself in the rendering of these passages.\nOn a few other occasions Paul talks about working with your hands doing good, and these passages too have been re-written in modern translations to include phrases like \u0026ldquo;work for a living,\u0026rdquo; thus bringing money into the picture and effectively pushing God, love, and faith out. But every single check of the earliest manuscripts shows that no hint of money ever appeared in any of them.\nShow this article to any expert who supports the tentmaking myth and they will immediately hush up. In fact, the most incredible thing about the whole myth is that it is never publicly taught as a Christian doctrine (because it can be so easily shot to bits) and yet it is the most widely known and supported teaching in so-called Christianity. It is always taught surreptitiously and in bits and pieces, so that the teachers can feign innocence when confronted with the facts.\nThis flimsiest of all false cornerstones persists in every denomination and cult. The simple truths stated in this article will not make one bit of difference to the millions who preach and practice the tentmaking myth. It never grew out of a desire to know the truth in the first place, and until their greed is replaced by faith in God\u0026rsquo;s provision, they\u0026rsquo;ll cling to it until their death.\nIf you are making the same mistake of hiding behind the tentmakers, we must solemnly warn you that you\u0026rsquo;ll never sneak it by God Almighty. Jesus says, \u0026ldquo;Follow me and I will make you living tents of the Holy Spirit!\u0026rdquo;\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/the-true-conscience/","title":"The True Conscience","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/deep/Conscience_hu_e66f2ee160cc6d6a.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"236\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/deep\\/Conscience_hu_2bc4f4b5869b0803.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/deep/Conscience_hu_28043c1c5a8f5b20.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/deep\\/Conscience_hu_dd55286f189738bb.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Deep Thoughts","tags":"Guidance, Conscience","content":"Note: The term \u0026ldquo;social conscience\u0026rdquo; as used in this article has a different meaning (within the Jesus Christian community) to that which it normally has in society. We are talking about giving in to pressure from society to behave in certain ways which may actually be contrary to what a genuine conscience might teach us. An example of this would be social pressure to participate in war, which can make a sincere conscientious objector feel \u0026ldquo;guilty\u0026rdquo; for not conforming. We are NOT referring to \u0026ldquo;social conscience\u0026rdquo; in the way it is normally used (i.e. to feel a need to help others who are in need). That kind of social conscience is something with which we would agree.It has struck me that I must have failed somewhere in my attempts to teach people to recognise and follow what we call our conscience.\nWe have talked about obeying God in terms of principles laid out in the teachings of Jesus, and we have warned against the deceptions of a \u0026ldquo;social conscience\u0026rdquo;* as opposed to what God wants. But in between these two concepts is a genuine inbuilt alarm system that God has given to us which can tell us when we are doing something immoral, unethical, or dishonest.\n(*We are not referring to concern about social injustices, but rather to doing good only because of what others will think of us.)\nGenerally speaking, this alarm is more or less a \u0026ldquo;silent system\u0026rdquo;. In other words, it\u0026rsquo;s a very \u0026ldquo;still, small voice\u0026rdquo; that we need to be listening very carefully for, if we are to hear it.\nIf we ignore the alarm, the still small voice appears to disappear; but a screaming siren of a different sort often takes its place.\nThe problem is that, having initially ignored the still small voice, most people just see the siren as a nuisance, and it is only those around you who are bothered by the siren. This siren produces acute anxiety in place of the original conviction, which we have ignored for so long. For someone looking on, the anxiety seems to be clear warning that something is seriously wrong with the alarm system; but for the person suffering anxiety, it is difficult to find a satisfying explanation for it.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll explain it in another way. You have an angel on one shoulder whispering in your ear and telling you when you have done something wrong. But you have a devil on the other shoulder, who appeals to your pride and tells you that you must defend yourself when you are criticised. The angel tries to point out the truth in the criticism, but the devil tries to get you to defend yourself against the criticism. The devil may allow you to give lip service to some bits of truth\u0026hellip; especially if he sees that there will be punishment from the group if you don\u0026rsquo;t own up to them. But on the whole, the devil doesn\u0026rsquo;t want you to get serious about changing. He won\u0026rsquo;t give an inch unless clearly pressured to do so.\nCriticism usually is aimed at getting you to change something. But the devil will point to all the ways you have changed in the past, and give you strong arguments to show that you are humble, teachable, sincere, and just generally good enough that you don\u0026rsquo;t really need to make further changes.\nAll of this has the effect of making the criticism seem unfair, and the anxiety justified.\nYet the anxiety comes because the criticism threatens to expose a \u0026ldquo;blind spot\u0026rdquo;. The blind spot often is nothing more than your pride. But often, anyone with a bit of common sense can see that you behave irrationally whenever someone gets too close to the truth about a blind spot. It is your irrationality that most convincingly proves the existence of the blind spot. It just takes gentle probing around the borders of the blind spot (e.g. your ego or self-image) to keep getting the same irrational reactions and defensiveness, which work together to destroy your conscience.\nIt is the job of a Christian counsellor (or team of counsellors) to first locate the blind spot through patient questioning, and then to bring this blind spot to the attention of the person suffering from it. It is not easy; but until it is accomplished, the true conscience will remain buried under it. Remember, the true conscience wants to tell you the truth about yourself, and your need to change; but listening to the devil has taught you to run from the truth, and to create a false self-image which must be defended, lest the true conscience come back to life and the devil be destroyed. If you are going to change at all, it will only be when you are forced to do so. All of this comes from lying to yourself.\nIf you read Gandhi\u0026rsquo;s autobiography, you will see that he was very sensitive about telling the truth in his childhood. I had a similar attitude toward telling the truth when I was young. However, as I grew older, I realised that it was necessary at times to hide the truth from people (often for their own good). So I developed the teaching about being \u0026ldquo;honest about our dishonesty\u0026rdquo;. I think that even Gandhi may have missed that aspect of honesty, thus deceiving himself into thinking that he was more honest than he really was. But the main point is that, we must do our utmost to never ever lie to ourselves or to God. For each time we do that, we create a blind spot in our personality which can easily spread to other blind spots, until it has destroyed our whole personality, and made total fruit cakes out of us.\nSystemites do this all the time; so that they are all crazy to some degree. They have run away from all kinds of uncomfortable truths, leaving many of them free to only carry on very basic animal-like functions from day to day. They cannot face up to important subjects like death, God, and the teachings of Jesus. It has caused them to turn to myths like money, evolution, and selfishness to stuff in the gaps in their understanding of life.\nFor religious people like ourselves the replacement for the truths we have shut out is self-righteousness of one sort or another.\nBasically, our conscience tells us when we are doing something wrong, or even when we are getting close to doing something wrong. But we need to \u0026ldquo;practise\u0026rdquo; listening to it. Practise thinking about things that you have done wrong, or things that you feel a little uncomfortable about spiritually. Practise thinking about whether or not you are applying the same principles to others that you apply to yourself, and vice versa. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t already done so, practise opening up to someone (preferably someone you can trust deeply with such secrets) about things you have done wrong in the past. Practise going to people and confessing things (even very little things) that you have done wrong recently and gotten away with. In conversation practise listening to your conscience, asking it if you are being totally fair and honest in your responses and criticisms. Especially practise listening to your conscience when someone is criticising you, to see if there isn\u0026rsquo;t some truth in the criticism.\nYou may need to stuff a sock in the mouth of the devil who is telling you that the criticism is too harsh, that it exaggerates some things, etc. But if you will do it, you will start to discover a spiritual freedom and confidence that you never had before.\nIt may help to understand that the social conscience and the true conscience are closely linked. The social conscience does the \u0026ldquo;right thing\u0026rdquo; as defined by the group, whether it be society as a whole or our own little fellowship. It may actually be the right thing that to do, but if you are primarily looking to others in the group for reassurance that you are doing the right thing, it is an indication that your conscience may be more \u0026ldquo;social\u0026rdquo; than godly. We never totally outgrow our need for a social conscience. However, there needs to be a steady growth in our ability to know what is right, and to act on it, simply because our conscience (i.e. the true conscience) tells us to do so.\nThis is particularly important if you are going to try to lead. Leadership brings far too much freedom and power for you to avoid corruption if you aren\u0026rsquo;t controlled directly by God in how you use that power and freedom.\nSo, in conclusion, can I call on each of you to make serious efforts to listen more to your conscience, and to hunt down and eradicate the blind spots that are crippling so many of you in your walk with God? I think we will find the results positive and encouraging. Happy hunting!\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/the-virgin-army/","title":"The Virgin Army","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/VirginA_hu_ce6c7ec8e07c71cd.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/VirginA_hu_b9dbc6c9a56b4ade.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/VirginA_hu_9b43d6a6674a7d57.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/VirginA_hu_3692baf700f626b4.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Top Forty","tags":"The Virgin Army, Prophesy","content":"The seventh chapter of The Revelation (about the army of 144,000 people) has, like so much of The Revelation, been ignored by most Christians on the basis that it could be misinterpreted by fanatics to make them think they are part of the army and others are not. How silly!\nAt the very least, we need to take more seriously the lessons which are implied in the overall passage, since they probably will relate to us at some time in the future. We shouldn\u0026rsquo;t just tear that chapter out of the Bible because it may be misunderstood.\nWhat lessons am I talking about?\nFor starters, I\u0026rsquo;m talking about the fact that these 144,000 people are \u0026ldquo;virgins\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;which were not defiled with women\u0026rdquo;. In the past I have offered a liberal, highly spiritualised interpretation of this passage. I have done much the same with other passages in the New Testament about celibacy, suggesting that people could be married without it affecting their ability to work for God, so long as they didn\u0026rsquo;t have children. I personally still believe both of these more spiritualised teachings, and I will elaborate on them a bit more later in this study.\nBut our experience has been that couples have used those teachings to avoid other parts of the Bible that are much clearer about our need to forsake our spouses and children for God. And, having taken that first step, to get married, most of them have later fallen away from literal obedience to just about anything else that Jesus taught.\nI do not see any point in forbidding marriage (as the Catholics do for their leaders), since the Bible teaches that such a doctrine is wrong. But I think we need to do like the Bible does, and be fairly certain about telling people where marriage is likely to lead them. Chances are that, if any of you singles get married, we are going to lose a couple more radical 100% sold-out red-hot warriors for Christ. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be that way, but, based on past experience, it probably will be.\nSo I am now starting to believe that the army of 144,000 may in fact be literally virgins, who have kept themselves from women. I would still question the \u0026ldquo;virginity\u0026rdquo; thing a bit as a literal condition that excludes for life anyone who has ever had sex. I think that it probably means something more along the lines of \u0026ldquo;holy\u0026rdquo; people who have been set aside for the Master\u0026rsquo;s use, and who stubbornly refuse to let sex distract them from God\u0026rsquo;s will. It may even be that a married person could become part of that army\u0026hellip; but the conditions would still be pretty strict.\nPaul says to the Corinthians, \u0026ldquo;The time remains that those who have wives should be as though they had none.\u0026rdquo; In other words, there may be an option for those of us who are married to still make it into the army, but the only way we could do it would be by very seriously and perhaps very literally forsaking our wives. The Catholic Church has something along those lines, where a married man can become a priest by literally leaving his wife. The system in general is shocked by it, but the Catholics still do it. And I think that is just a small sample of what God is wanting us to do. What Paul said is echoed by Jesus when he says that no man can come after him unless he is willing to \u0026ldquo;hate\u0026rdquo; his wife.\nI have, for too long, been afraid of people calling us a cult that breaks up marriages. So I have bent over backwards to accommodate rebellious wives. Some members have clenched their fists every time I even hinted at husbands forsaking their wives for God. I thank God that we are finally free of that rebellious spirit, and I pray that we will never tolerate it again.\nOver the years I have had many disagreements with my wife, but the end of the story is that I have not let her stop me from following God, and she is now behind me more than she has ever been in her life. We put God first, and God has rewarded us.\nI like this fresh new, radical approach that we have taken, that does not require us to justify ourselves to any of our friends, ex-members, relatives, or other system \u0026ldquo;authorities\u0026rdquo;. All of these people unanimously \u0026ldquo;despise authority\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; ours, God\u0026rsquo;s, or anyone\u0026rsquo;s except their own. They are not convinced, as we are, that we have found the answer in the teachings of Jesus. They do not regard his teachings as the pearl of great price for which they would sell all that they own. Some of our ex-members and many of our friends and relatives do not even regard themselves as Christians\u0026hellip; not because Christ has let them down, but because they have let him down.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not saying that we don\u0026rsquo;t try to be friendly with them, but that we remember: fence-sitters are never neutral, although they always pretend they are. In fact, they are usually the most dangerous of \u0026ldquo;friends\u0026rdquo;. All of these people are governed by a social conscience, i.e. a need to be accepted in the eyes of others. Even their occasional niceties are carefully calculated to prove something to us, to each other, and/or to the system.\nSo what I am suggesting now is that we must at least be willing to cut our ties with all of these vestiges of respectability that each of our system and family friendships represents, and to spiritually disappear, if need be, into the great unknown in the way of all so-called \u0026ldquo;cults\u0026rdquo;. It is the willingness of any group to cut all ties with their families and with the system that gets them labelled a cult in the first place; but it is this same willingness that makes them so effective. It may be time for us to discover the same effectiveness.\nIf the virgin army only includes those who have kept themselves from women (i.e. bachelors to the rapture) then all of these guys who are being led around by their wives are out before they even start. It may even mean that the remaining married couples in our community are, at best, only going to be part of some kind of an army auxiliary, shouting encouragement to the rest of you guys from the sidelines. I expect that if the single guys are cut down to just literal virgins (in the modern understanding of the word), then we may be very close to finding ourselves with no disciples at all.\nNevertheless, if that is the standard, then that is what we must preach, and toward which we should aspire. It is only the grace of God that may allow some of us to be part of the virgin army; but I believe that his grace will only be made available to those of us who are prepared to acknowledge what the standards at least should be. And those standards include forsaking wives and children for Christ.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like what we have experienced with remarried divorcees. We have, at times, said that we would accept couples that had been remarried for many years, as long as they would teach that in principle, what they did was wrong, i.e. that they should not have remarried after being divorced. But no, they wanted to make the standard fit their conduct rather than make their conduct (or at least the conduct of those whom they might influence) come closer to the standard; and so they have, all of them, flatly refused to teach such a principle.\nWe must not let ourselves do this with regard to the virgin army. If forsaking wives and children is the standard, then so be it.\nIf we understand that this concept of being \u0026ldquo;virgins\u0026rdquo; and being \u0026ldquo;separate from women\u0026rdquo; is part of a direction on a continuum, and something that spiritually reflects every area of our life, then we should be teaching it and doing all that we can to start practising it now. Whether or not we ever qualify for membership in the army ourselves, we \u0026ldquo;sons of God\u0026rdquo; need to be totally sold out to God the Father, so that no beguiling spirit (or spirit of Eve) can come between us and him. We that are married should be as though we were not in this regard.\nI think we can only teach such a doctrine by recognising the legitimacy of masturbation. That\u0026rsquo;s a vital key that has been left out by everyone I know of who has taught celibacy. Because it has been left out, sexual hypocrisy and perversion has resulted. (Note: Even the anti-masturbation teaching is a product of the Jezebel influence in the churches, where mothers dictated what was right and wrong for their sons, rather than honest fathers.)\nBy accepting masturbation, I can even accept being separated from my wife for Christ. Being a virgin does not mean that I am asexual. But by practising masturbation, I do not have to let my sexual needs dictate my lifestyle. My sexual needs are like my other biological needs\u0026hellip; i.e. just biological. I can\u0026rsquo;t stop going to the toilet for God, but I can agree not to do so in public (for example) without feeling that it is an impossible ethic to follow. And the same is true of sex. I can\u0026rsquo;t stop ejaculation, but I can agree that I will not engage in illegitimate sex, and I can agree that it will not compromise my role as spiritual leader in my family.\nSo what about singles who may want to marry? We cannot forbid any of them to marry, but I can pretty well promise them that if they do, they will end up feeling more comfortable working with ex-members than they will be working with us. And that is because we intend to grow quite literally toward the vision of being part of the virgin army, while all of the others are so afraid of appearing to be cultish that their hands are tied spiritually. They are being controlled by the spirit of Jezebel, usually in the form of their own wives. We have watched backslidden wives slowly strangle their husbands spiritually, as they themselves grew more and more toward becoming spiritual nonentities.\nI might add that the same situation exists throughout all the churches, where there is hardly a leader anywhere who has control over his own family. The sin isn\u0026rsquo;t that they are married, but that in the important spiritual decisions that these husbands must make, they are \u0026ldquo;defiled by women\u0026rdquo; (i.e. by their emotional dependence on their wives). Because they feel that they cannot live without their wives, they become wimps for God. Under such conditions, they cannot do anything but teach that rebellious wives must be tolerated by the rest of the community.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t hate women. God knows, I love my wife dearly. But the devil is always going to take the one you love most and use that person to pull you away from God. We just cannot tolerate that any more.\nIf any of our men get married and problems arise, we are going to insist that they bring their wives into line. You married men are going to be faced with the possibility that your wives will refuse to have sex with you or leave you if you try to take a hard line with them, and that is when you will find out both what your wives are made of and what you are made of.\nWhile you are operating under some perverted doctrine of grace, where you make no demands on your wives, you will never know what they are capable of spiritually. But when you lay down the law of God, they are either going to submit and become true followers of Christ, or they are going to rebel and show themselves to be agents of the devil.\nCertainly if any men in our community are considering marriage, it would be a lot easier to lay the law down now, when rebellion from the potential wife will leave you open to marry someone else some day, or better still, to be part of the virgin army.\nJust ruling marriage out as a recommended option does not rule it out as a possibility. We will go ahead and perform marriage ceremonies for any consenting adults who have not been married before. But I am saying, as St. Paul said, that people who get married are going to be faced with incredible temptations that will very likely make them pretty much ineffectual for God.\nIt may be that, in some hypothetical situation, God himself could actually encourage a person to get married. But if that is true, then it is up to God to make it clear. The instructions we have from scripture are that it\u0026rsquo;s better to stay single, and we should discourage marriage as a general principle.\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t handle being single, then go ahead, but, as Paul said, there are going to be problems (and one of them is that your wife is probably going to start nagging you for kids).\nIn the meantime, let\u0026rsquo;s start encouraging our little army of bachelors not to go looking for potential wives, but to go looking for more bachelors (and women, too, who are committed to staying single for God) to add to the army. For you are the ones who are going to make our little Virgin Army cult most effective!\nGod bless you!\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/the-top-forty-commandments-of-jesus/","title":"Top Forty Commandments of Jesus","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/TopForty_hu_3e41558f89ef8d9e.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"236\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/TopForty_hu_61f29ae236eb2421.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/TopForty_hu_94f4a2cd47b43fc2.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/TopForty_hu_5be4de6dd5c7bd6e.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Top Forty","tags":"The Teachings of Jesus","content":"1.

(1 Corinthians 6:1-5) We do this when talking to people on the street, and we choose between spending time with them, or not spending time with them because we think that other people need our time more. (Matthew 7:6) We do this when a person wants to join our group; we must say if we think they are joining for good reasons or for bad reasons. (John 6:26, Luke 11:29; Luke 14:25-26) And we must be able to judge ourselves too, to know if we are doing things for good reasons or for bad reasons. (1 Corinthians 11:31)\nWe call this \u0026ldquo;trying\u0026rdquo; the spirits. In a court, where a judge must do the same thing, they call it a \u0026ldquo;trial\u0026rdquo; because the judge is \u0026ldquo;trying\u0026rdquo; the person who is in front of him or her.\nBelow is a list of spiritual tests that can help you to judge in the right way. (John 7:24)\nA. Fruit/Love One test is to look at the effects (or fruit) of what a person is saying. (Matthew 7:20) When a person does or says something, ask yourself, \u0026ldquo;Why is this being said, and what will it lead to?\u0026rdquo; Any spirit that comes from God will come from and/or lead to spirits like love, happiness, honesty, and humility. (Galatians 5:22-23)\nWhen people are saying why they disagree with another person, they may be doing it because they love the other person. (Hebrews 12:6) But if they are not acting out of love, there will be anger in what they are saying, with very little thinking about how to fix the problem. They will be more interesting in hurting the other person. This is a bad spirit.\nB. Teachings of Jesus Here is another test. Look at how much a person loves the teachings of Jesus. (2 John 9) Many people say they are Christians, but they do not think the teachings of Jesus are very important. (Luke 6:46) They argue against obeying Jesus, for one reason or another. These people have a bad spirit.\nThere are other people who do NOT say they are Christians, but they show a real interest in the things that Jesus said. If people receive the teachings of Jesus, they are the true Christians. (John 1:11-12) When we are teaching the things that Jesus said, we know that people with a good spirit will be interested in what we are saying and in what we are writing. If they are not, it is a good reason to think that they are not interested in following God. (Matthew 10:40)\nC. Enthusiasm Enthusiasm is another test. The word comes from two words in another language that mean \u0026ldquo;filled with God\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen someone is very interested in (enthused about) things that lead us closer to God (like the teachings of Jesus, being able to work for God, loving others, or learning new truths) it shows they have enthusiasm (or God in them). (1 Thessalonians 5:16-19)\nIf you must push people to make them do these things, it is not a good sign. They do not have \u0026ldquo;enthusiasm\u0026rdquo;. If people are enthusiastic, they will be thinking about the things you say long after you have stopped talking. They will want to know more. They will learn new truths by themselves.\nAt times they will not understand what you say, or they will disagree with you, and because of this, they will ask questions\u0026hellip; not to argue, but to understand better. And they will listen closely to your answers.\nIf you give a good answer to a question that a person asks you, and they quickly change to a different argument, it is a sign that they do not want to hear good answers; all they are looking for is a way to argue against (or to move away from) the teachings of Jesus. If people say that they agree with all that we say, but they show no interest in saying or hearing more, most likely they have not truly listened to what we said.\nD. What they Say One of the easiest ways to know what spirit is in a person is to listen closely to what they say. The spirit that is in them will come out through their mouth. (Matthew 12:34-35)\nPeople who do not have God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit will try to talk about \u0026ldquo;spiritual\u0026rdquo; things, but in the end, they will not be able to stop talking about \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo; things. Real truth changes people, and these people do not want to change. To hide from real truth, they will talk about things like heaven, hell, rules about God, churches, the name of Jesus (or God), and other teachings that will not change their lives. (Matthew 22:23-28) They will ask questions about our group name, how we started, what our understanding of God is, and who is our leader, but not about our interest in the teachings of Jesus. Religious people are almost never spiritual people.\nDo not talk to people who want only to argue about words. (2 Timothy 2:14, Matthew 16:6) People can talk about how they understand words differently, but when it becomes an argument, and when it happens each time you try to talk about the teachings of Jesus, it is their way of saying that they do not want to obey what the teaching is saying. Arguing will not change them.\nE. Talking in Secret People who do not have God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit are not honest. They say different things to different people. They do not want many people to listen when they say things. They want to talk to you away from other people. This is because they want to tell you lies about people who are not there, and because they will be free to tell lies about what you said in return.\nIf a person is telling the truth, they will want others to hear what they are saying. (John 3:20-21) Do not talk to people who want to talk to you secretly. (Luke 12:1-3)\nF. Money The last rule is to study the way people act and talk about money. The Bible says that it will tell us much about where their heart is. (Matthew 6:21-23) If they lose interest in working for God when there is no money in it for them, and if they are quick to give arguments against giving money to others, or if they only become enthusiastic about something when they receive money for doing it, it is a good sign that they do not have God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit.

So if, for example, we want freedom to distribute our literature, then we believe that they should have the same freedom. If it is wrong for them to cause division in our ranks, then we must not deliberately set out to cause division in their ranks. And so on and so on.\nBut occasionally we find ourselves in a situation where it just doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem right to apply the same principle to both sides. A situation along these lines came up in Kerala, South India, years ago, in which I found myself saying, \u0026ldquo;But the difference is that we are right and they are wrong.\u0026rdquo;\nOur natural response was to actually laugh at such an argument. We had become so indoctrinated by the values of a society which does not know the difference between right and wrong, that we thought such a claim was laughable.\nAfter all, claiming that we are right and they are wrong is the reasoning behind every war. It\u0026rsquo;s the claim that has been made by every new division in the Christian church. It\u0026rsquo;s the justification for racism and bigotry. But there is one difference between those illustrations and our own use of the phrase: We really are right and they really are wrong!\nSee, they use \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; hypocritically, without any genuine attempt to arrive at the truth. There is no humble examination of themselves for sin and error. They show no concern for the welfare of others, and especially not for their enemies. So, obviously, the fruit of their argument is always going to be bad. But it should not scare off someone who is sincerely seeking the truth, and following the other criteria listed above, from showing some kind of confidence about what we have discovered as a result.\nAs long as we always stay open to new knowledge, and open to a higher revelation of truth, we do not need to throw out the confidence we now have in what we have found. And what we have found is the Son of God, the Creator of the Universe. We have found the Way, the Truth, and the Life.\nWhen we first started as a community, we discussed what to call ourselves. \u0026ldquo;Why not just call ourselves Christians?\u0026rdquo; someone asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Because that\u0026rsquo;s what all the churchies call themselves, and we don\u0026rsquo;t want to be confused with them,\u0026rdquo; someone else responded.\n\u0026ldquo;But Christian is what we are,\u0026rdquo; came back the answer. \u0026ldquo;We really are following Jesus, and the churchies aren\u0026rsquo;t. So why should we be the ones to retreat and go looking for a new name, when we are the ones that the name rightly belongs to in the first place?\u0026rdquo;\nSee, the only difference between us and the churchies is that the name is \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; for us, and \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; for them. We\u0026rsquo;re both fighting over the same name\u0026hellip; but we are entitled to it and they aren\u0026rsquo;t. Is that a double standard? Or is it just a simple fact that anyone could test by studying the evidence?\nWe have been known to break the law by painting Christian graffiti along railway lines, by distributing Christian literature where it is forbidden, by converting Hindu university students to faith in Jesus. But that does not obligate us to defend all law-breakers, or even all graffitists. Why? Because we\u0026rsquo;re right and most of the others are wrong.\nWe have called the police to report our car stolen. Church leaders have also called the police\u0026hellip; to have us removed from their church meetings for giving roses to members of the congregation. What\u0026rsquo;s the difference? The difference is that we were morally right in our action, while they were morally wrong.\nMan looks on the outward appearance, but God looks on the heart. Until we examine the motives behind actions (and God has given us a lot of information on how to do that), it cannot be said that people are equally right or wrong just because they are engaging in similar activities.\nThere is far too much violence in the world today; and yet Jesus will destroy millions at the Battle of Armageddon, and then proceed to rule the world with a \u0026ldquo;rod of iron\u0026rdquo;. How is that different from what governments are now doing? Only one difference\u0026hellip; Jesus is right, and they are wrong. Jesus will be genuinely seeking the good of all, while the others only hypocritically claim to be doing that, at the same time that they secretly lust after wealth and power for themselves.\nThe list could go on and on, and in a way it could cover anything. Anything done in a sincere desire to serve and obey God becomes good and right, no matter how wrong or foolish it may appear to be to human eyes; and anything not done in obedience to God becomes evil, no matter how impressive it may be to human understanding.\nThis is a frightening teaching, for it can be used to justify anything, even murder. And it has been used to justify anything, including murder. Using it to justify something, however, is wrong; but using it to give confidence to those who are honestly and humbly seeking to know and follow the will of God is not.\nCan you see the difference? We who are sincerely seeking to know and follow the will of God are right\u0026hellip; and they are wrong!\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/what-conterfiet-jesus-would-do/","title":"What Would False Jesus Do?","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/hesu/WWFJD_hu_eae6bc0084d076df.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"280\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/hesu\\/WWFJD_hu_61ed0019fda211f5.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/hesu/WWFJD_hu_dbbd5be3ad29942f.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/hesu\\/WWFJD_hu_81316945e7eebdb0.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Jesus and Money","tags":"The Teachings of Jesus, Money, Jesus","content":"There is a slogan making the rounds in church circles (especially in the U.S.) which asks \u0026ldquo;What would Jesus do?\u0026rdquo; It is abbreviated WWJD? and the letters feature on everything from T-shirts to jewellery. They act both as a reminder to the person wearing them and as an opening to a Christian witness when the uninformed ask what they stand for.\nWe love the slogan, because we want to get Christians literally following the teachings of Jesus instead of following the various doctrines which have been created in his name. We believe that a Christian is a follower and imitator of Jesus; so anything that gets people thinking about what Jesus would do in any given circumstance is a step in the right direction.\nParents especially find the WWJD? practice helpful in getting their young people to stay on the straight and narrow. Young people refrain from smoking, drinking, swearing, telling dirty jokes, and associating with unseemly characters as a response to the question whenever it comes up in their mind. They behave respectfully, go to church regularly, and avoid sexual contact with others.\nBut we are still concerned that this new trend is being heavily influenced by a misunderstanding with regard to who the real Jesus is. Too many young people are asking themselves \u0026ldquo;What would a false Jesus (or Jesuses) do?\u0026rdquo; (WWFJD?) and the answers they are coming up with do not resemble the real biblical Jesus of history.\nWe must confess that some of the false Jesuses have reunited families, enabled people to get off drugs, to avoid bad social influences, and to stop gambling. They have brought people back to church meetings and Bible studies, reformed criminals, helped people to overcome stress, to stay healthier, to find jobs, and to gain promotions. Much of this is commendable. But the one thing they do not do is to save souls. Not one person will find eternal life through the false Jesuses that exist only in their imaginations.\nReforms can be accomplished through government organisations, through service clubs, and through other individuals and organisations which make no claim to giving eternal life. But eternal life is something that can only come from God himself. It is a miracle of such proportions that you can be sure that there will be no room for cheating on the instructions to obtain it. If you really want to receive eternal life, then it would pay you to read the fine print carefully, and not to fall for any counterfeits.\nLast night I had a dream. I had purchased an extremely cheap non-refundable ticket on an ocean cruise\u0026hellip; something I\u0026rsquo;ve often dreamed of being able to afford. But when I got to the docks, I discovered that the cruise \u0026ldquo;ship\u0026rdquo; was an inflatable dingy, which was so constructed that if I were to move at all on it, it would simply sink. Nothing I could do would make the \u0026ldquo;ship\u0026rdquo; live up to my expectations, and it was too late to get a refund.\nThis is how it is with false Jesuses. They may work fine when it comes to some social issues, like helping people to adjust to life in modern society. But when you move out onto the oceans of life after death, they are totally useless. And by the time most people realise that, it is too late to get a refund.\nI would like to discuss a number of different types of false Jesuses that have confused people, and which have actually led them away from the genuine Jesus of the Bible. There is a lot of overlap between these various Jesuses, and some will almost seem to be identical, since most of us have borrowed from several to get a vague picture in our minds of how Jesus would act in various circumstances.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with the Orthodox Jesus. This is the one that follows the fundamental doctrinal teachings of whatever church he happens to be attending. The Orthodox Jesus would never think to question or challenge local church teachings, although he would definitely challenge the teachings of any group that was labelled a cult, or otherwise identified as being outside the mainstream of orthodoxy. Obviously, this Jesus contradicts the Jesus of the Bible, who was actually executed as a heretic by the orthodox religious leaders of his day.\nNext, there is the Law-Abiding Jesus. This one would never think to disobey any of the laws of the land. He would regard the police force as upholders of righteousness, because they protect law-abiding citizens from the criminal elements in our society. This Jesus also contradicts the biblical Jesus, who was on the run from Jewish authorities for having broken certain regulations with regard to working on the Sabbath, and for having made some questionable statements about whether or not his followers needed to pay taxes. His hideout was finally discovered with the help of a traitor from his own gang, and he was arrested by the civil authorities on the grounds that his behaviour and teachings were a threat to the stability of the government. He was eventually executed as a common criminal.\nThen there is the Patriotic Jesus. He loves his country, and would gladly lay down his life in defence of all that it stands for. But the real Jesus was instrumental in challenging the corruption that existed in his country. (It existed because of compromise between the religious authorities and the political authorities.) Jesus prophesied the destruction of his own country, which he said would serve as a stepping stone to the development of a better government that would be invisible and universal. He called this revolutionary new government \u0026ldquo;the kingdom of heaven\u0026rdquo;.\nNext there is the Traditional Jesus. The Traditional Jesus has many of the same traits that the Jesuses we have already listed have; but he also supports behaviours and practices which are not required by the laws of the land, but which are just part of the local culture. He is conservative, and he looks with suspicion on anyone who would try to change the traditional ways of doing things, whether it be religious practices or social taboos.\nThis is the one who promotes good table manners, Sunday worship, white shirts and ties, frequent use of terms like \u0026lsquo;sir\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;madam\u0026rsquo;, and circumspect behaviour at all social events. By contrast, the real Jesus was not afraid to call religious leaders \u0026ldquo;damned hypocrites\u0026rdquo;, to knock over tables in the Temple, to break Sabbath regulations, to associate with publicans and sinners, and to eat food with unwashed hands.\nThere are other similar Jesuses, such as the Polite Jesus, the Popular Jesus, the Successful Jesus, or the Respectable Jesus. They, too, always know how to behave in such a way as to avoid scandal, and not rock the boat. There is a great deal of unity between all of these various Jesuses, so that it is often difficult to tell one from the other. Unfortunately, aspects of each of these false Jesuses come to mind these days whenever you ask church-educated people, \u0026ldquo;What Would Jesus Do?\u0026rdquo; And they usually overlook what the real Jesus would do, as a result.\nThere has arisen yet another Jesus in recent years: He is the Trendy Jesus. At first glance, he appears to be nearer to the radical Jesus of the Bible. But on close examination, he is a disappointment too. The Trendy Jesus does choose to question the way things are going, but his suggestions for change always fall short of actually exposing all of the other Jesuses for the phonies that they are. What the Trendy Jesus wants is minor changes to the system without losing the support of the very system that he seeks to change.\nTrendy Jesuses introduce new fads and gimmicks (such as WWJD? engraved on bracelets and necklaces), modern music, variations to the worship service, changes in dress regulations, emphases which reflect political trends toward increased environmental awareness, greater tolerance of racial, religious, and sexual differences, and moves to get the government (always the government, and not the Trendy Jesus himself) to help the poor, and right the wrongs of the world.\nBut we do not find either gimmicks or efforts to stir the government into action in the life and teachings of the real Jesus\u0026hellip; the one who alone can give eternal life. And the reason for this is because the real Jesus was not trying to promote the systems of the world, or trying to achieve success in the eyes of the world around him. He was only interested in promoting faith in an omnipotent, eternal God.\nHe had come from heaven, and he knew that he would be returning to heaven. Eternal life was not going to be found in the systems of man, but only in harmony and fellowship with God the Father, the Creator of all life.\nWhether you are a conformer or a reformer, what Jesus wants you to consider is becoming a spiritual revolutionary instead\u0026hellip; one who has dropped out of the rat race and caught sight of an eternal kingdom which exists in the hearts of all those who have such faith in God. What would Jesus do? He would do like Abraham, and kill his own son if God told him to. He would cut off his hand before he would let it stop him from gaining eternal life. He would lay down his own life for God and for others. He would forsake everything that he owns to have eternal life. He would leave his family, his friends, his job, his home, and go into all the world preaching the good news of an eternal kingdom that only comes when we let go of all the other counterfeits.\nAre you ready to become his follower, and do what he would do?\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/why-so-much-persecution/","title":"Why So Much Persecution?","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/quak/Persecution_hu_3ca6531e6fa147ce.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"176\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/quak\\/Persecution_hu_48de834c83ac2359.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/quak/Persecution_hu_301f255d12c086d0.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/quak\\/Persecution_hu_4f550d768ea25038.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Quaker Similarities","tags":"Persecution","content":"The following article quotes William Penn, an early Quaker, with regard to persecution. Modern Day Quakers are highly respected around the world; but there was a time when they, like the Jesus Christians, were sorely persecuted for their faith.\nA woman once asked us why we Jesus Christians thought we were getting so much persecution. I confided in her that I thought it had something to do with us being Christians. Her expression showed that she was personally offended by such a claim. After all, she too was a professing Christian, and she was not being persecuted.\nIn her defence, another friend took up the same refrain. He referred to another professing Christian, and said, \u0026ldquo;Could you imagine others being upset with her the way people are upset with you?\u0026rdquo; Well, no, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t, I said, but did that mean that popularity should become the touchstone of righteousness?\nWilliam Penn, in his essay \u0026ldquo;No Cross, No Crown\u0026rdquo;, writes about early Quaker practices, such as refusing to remove one\u0026rsquo;s hat in the presence of someone regarded as socially superior. He says that these things were not things that Quakers necessarily had to do, but that it seemed fitting if they were to treat everyone equally. (\u0026ldquo;We feared to use lawful things, lest we should use them unlawfully.\u0026rdquo;) The outcry that it brought from the supposedly social superiors, including hundreds of arrests and many years of imprisonment, was what convinced them more than anything that what they were doing was right.\nFor these early Quakers, persecution which seemed out of proportion to the act that brought it on, was clear evidence of the rightness of the act. (\u0026ldquo;If we had wanted a proof of the truth of our inward belief and judgment, the very practice of them that opposed it would have abundantly confirmed us.\u0026rdquo;)\nThe Bible warns against being persecuted for doing evil, but it encourages us to rejoice when persecuted for doing good. (1 Peter 4:15-16) We talk about Jesus going around doing good, and then being hated and persecuted for it. But why do people react like that?\nPenn went on in that same essay, to say that there is an authority that comes with doing good. Pride on the part of others causes them to be jealous of this spiritual authority. And their lust for such power makes them hate us and want to see us destroyed. (\u0026ldquo;How specious soever might be the pretences of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram against Moses, it was their emulation of his mighty power in the camp of Israel, that put them upon conspiracies and mutinies. They longed for his authority, and their not having it was his crime.\u0026rdquo;)\nAbsalom\u0026rsquo;s campaign for the rights of the people against the tyrannies of his father, King David are touched on by Penn. He says that this was a pretence, hiding Absalom\u0026rsquo;s ambition. How typical of what we have encountered from those who say we seek to control and manipulate. They indict themselves and their own desires to control and manipulate.\nPenn wrote of the paradox, in that those who cease to seek greatness actually achieve it, and when they do, others become jealous. How often do we slip into measuring our greatness by how many members we have, or by how many books we have been able to distribute? But, in fact, our greatness really lies in the simple truth of the message which we have proclaimed.\nRecently, some who have known us almost exclusively through our political activism have turned on us when they learned of our Christian faith. (If they can find nothing better to attack us for, we are attacked for having kept our Christian faith \u0026ldquo;secret\u0026rdquo;, thereby tricking them into working with us!)\nSo we have, in fact, achieved a greatness (or authority) which is disproportionate to our size. Our authority is that of Jesus himself, of whom it was said, \u0026ldquo;He spoke as one who had authority, and not as one of the scribes or Pharisees.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen we go in the name of Jesus (i.e. backed up by what he said, and not just saying \u0026ldquo;Lord, Lord\u0026rdquo;), we have this same authority, as he promised we would have. Kings and armies are forced to hide from the dazzling power of that Light which we hold forth.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/wisdom/","title":"Wisdom","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/hesu/Wisdom_hu_6e778fa257cbaea2.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"213\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/hesu\\/Wisdom_hu_f207670249564712.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/hesu/Wisdom_hu_2c4b66732be3d792.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/hesu\\/Wisdom_hu_4c07a67df1af20a5.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Jesus and Money","tags":"The Teachings of Jesus, Wisdom, Guidance","content":"A number of children\u0026rsquo;s stories tell of someone getting one or more wishes, and then wasting them on things that do not bring happiness. As a boy I had heard the story of Solomon being given a wish by God. (2 Chronicles 1:7-12) It was not so different from the fairy tales, except that this one had a ring of truth about it. What a privilege it would have been to be given a wish by God! And how clever of Solomon to have asked for wisdom.\nHe could have asked for wealth, power, or health; but, by asking for wisdom, he gained the others as well. Wisdom is the ability to make the right choices between several apparently equal alternatives. Indeed, it must have taken a bit of wisdom just to have known to ask for it.\nAs I heard the story, the obvious conclusion for me was that I should be asking for wisdom too. I don\u0026rsquo;t know my age when I first prayed for wisdom, but it would have been well before my teens. Over the years I have come to see how important those early prayers were.\nI later learned that Jesus had promised his followers that they could receive things from God if they asked for them in his \u0026ldquo;name\u0026rdquo; (whatever that meant). And I read where James (apparently the brother of Jesus) said, \u0026ldquo;If any of you lacks wisdom, then ask God for it, and he will give it.\u0026rdquo; (James 1:5-6) I felt renewed hope that my request for wisdom would be granted.\nAs I grew up, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t so different from other children my own age. I enjoyed sports, food, and a good joke. So when my father would tell me that I had no common sense, my hopes of ever finding wisdom faded.\nThen I read that God\u0026rsquo;s wisdom is considered to be foolishness by most people. (1 Corinthians 1:25) Could my lack of what my father called \u0026ldquo;common sense\u0026rdquo; at least be partly caused by some uncommon wisdom?\nFinally, I discovered the rest of the teachings of Jesus, and with them this comment by our Lord: \u0026ldquo;The Queen of Sheba travelled all the way from her home country to listen to King Solomon\u0026rsquo;s wise teachings, and yet there is someone here who is wiser than Solomon.\u0026rdquo; (Luke 11:31)\nHe went on: \u0026ldquo;The wild flowers don\u0026rsquo;t work or make clothes for themselves, yet not even King Solomon with all his wealth had clothes as beautiful as one of these flowers. If God can clothe the grass of the field so beautifully, won\u0026rsquo;t he clothe you too if you have faith!\u0026rdquo; (Luke 12:27-28)\nI studied the Sermon on the Mount and noted that it finished with a story about a wise man and a foolish man. The wise man was the one who heard the teachings of Jesus and then obeyed them. Nothing could shake his \u0026ldquo;house\u0026rdquo;. The foolish man heard it all, but he did not obey.\nOver the years I have discovered that the world is populated almost entirely by fools: People who mouth platitudes, but never take them seriously. They tell stories about asking for wisdom, but never sincerely ask for it for themselves. They talk about life being more than material wealth, then live like nothing matters except making money. They listen to the teachings of Jesus, but never even consider obeying them. Fools! Every last one of them.\nWe have, in the teachings of Jesus, the formula for becoming even wiser than Solomon, and yet people let it slip away, because they would rather waste their lives on trivia. What a tragedy!\nWisdom has nothing to do with IQ or university degrees. It does not require superhuman discipline or self-control. People lack wisdom simply because they rarely ever think to ask for it. Their lives are wasted seeking everything else except the ability to make the right choices about what to seek in the first place.\nParadoxically, I discovered that wisdom is the greatest form of common sense.\nFor example\u0026hellip; Common sense tells me that we are all going to die one day, and about half of us will die on the youthful side of the national average. It could happen any day. And when it happens, nothing will matter anywhere near as much as whether or not we spent our life doing good\u0026hellip; for God and for others. No theological statement will matter when we stand before God. What will matter is whether or not we acted on the truth we had received; and the best truth I know of comes from Someone who claimed to be God\u0026rsquo;s only begotten Son.\nCommon sense tells me to build my life on those teachings if I want to be in God\u0026rsquo;s good books. Common sense tells me that any little pleasure that I may miss out on by doing this would be a small price to pay to inherit the eternal life that Jesus Christ talked about.\nCommon sense tells me the things that matter to everyone else (a good reputation, a nice car and clothes, winning arguments, a good job, a big bank account) don\u0026rsquo;t really count at all one second after my heart stops beating.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s not all just pie in the sky when I die either. Common sense tells that a clear conscience, personal integrity, the confidence that comes from knowing the truth and not being afraid to speak it, and the good feeling of accomplishment when you know you have been making life better for others are all a lot more real and tangible than a can of Coke or a pair of Levi jeans.\nSo wisdom isn\u0026rsquo;t all that hard to get if you really want it. Only a fool would pass it up.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/en/blog/without-blemish/","title":"Without Guile","description":"this is meta description","date":"September 29, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/quak/Stain_hu_58c726397be52cb9.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"525\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/quak\\/Stain_hu_24ae9a187fed1909.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/articles/quak/Stain_hu_718aebccc6ae1786.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/articles\\/quak\\/Stain_hu_d3fd083a968bbc0c.webp';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Quaker Similarities","tags":"The Virgin Army, Theology","content":"In the article which follows, the Jesus Christians take a favorite Quaker passage of scripture (about \u0026lsquo;walking in the light\u0026rsquo;) and combine it with some of the favorite evangelical \u0026lsquo;salvation\u0026rsquo; scriptures, to present what is a favorite Jesus Christian teaching\u0026hellip; about sincerity. Several articles follow which also emphasise the need to be honest in preference to any theological demands. Such inclusivism is common to Quakers and Jesus Christians.\nThere are three traits which are used to describe the army of 144,000 faithful believers mentioned in The Revelation. They are referred to as \u0026lsquo;virgins\u0026rsquo; (Revelation 14:4), as \u0026ldquo;servants\u0026rdquo; of God (Revelation 7:3), and as being \u0026ldquo;without guile\u0026rdquo;. (Revelation 14:5)\nWe have, recently, been teaching about the first trait (the ability to forsake emotional ties in order to follow God); and in the past we have taught extensively about the second trait, which is the need to be obedient to the teachings of Jesus, and to \u0026ldquo;follow the Lamb wherever he goes\u0026rdquo; (Revelation 14:4), so we will not say more about these two traits at this time. We will concentrate on the third.\nThis absence of \u0026ldquo;guile\u0026rdquo; which characterises the 144,000 is essential if we are ever to be a part of this great army. If we have forsaken our loved ones for God, and if we are going through the motions of living by faith in obedience to Jesus, but if we are doing so with \u0026ldquo;guile\u0026rdquo; then it may all come to nothing in the end.\nGuile is an attempt to cover up (or hide from) the truth. The dictionary says that a \u0026ldquo;guileless\u0026rdquo; person is an innocent or honest person. There is a paradox here, however, for it does not take very long before a person who is genuinely trying to be honest begins to recognise signs of dishonesty in himself or herself. The honest truth, we discover, is that no one is perfectly honest. How disappointing!\nThe Bible says that \u0026ldquo;all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.\u0026rdquo; (Romans 3:23) So in the strict, literal sense, there is no such thing as one perfectly \u0026ldquo;innocent\u0026rdquo; person, much less 144,000 of them. About the best that any one of us can do is just to acknowledge the truth in that statement. We need to drop our defences and to start being honest about our DIShonesty.\nWhat a frustrating Catch-22! We must be honest to qualify for the 144,000, and yet the most honest people would have to disqualify themselves, because they know that they are not perfectly honest all the time!\nBut there is hope. The Bible says that the 144,000 \u0026ldquo;were redeemed from the world\u0026rdquo;. (Revelation 14:3) This word ˆredeemedˆ means something happened to them as a result of an outside force. They were \u0026ldquo;redeemed\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;bought back\u0026rdquo; from a lost or fallen state. In other words, despite our dishonesty, there is still hope for us; we may yet be \u0026ldquo;redeemed\u0026rdquo;. But to get that redemption, there must be some token gesture of honesty on our part. We must be honest about our dishonesty, guileless about our guilt; we must \u0026ldquo;confess our sins\u0026rdquo; in order to be \u0026ldquo;cleansed from all unrighteousness\u0026rdquo;. (1 John 1:9)\nThe Bible says, \u0026ldquo;If we say that we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\u0026rdquo; (1 John 1:8) We may not be able to claim perfect innocence by our own merits, but we can appropriate the innocence of Jesus if we can drop the religious cover-ups with regard to our own righteousness. We are talking about more than a ritual confession here. We are talking about a lifelong commitment to being honest every day of our lives, including being honest about our dishonesty. Definitely not the kind of behaviour one finds amongst those who claim the loudest to be \u0026ldquo;saved\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;redeemed\u0026rdquo;, is it?\nMost people underrate sincerity. They assume it\u0026rsquo;s a rather shallow trait that all of us possess to a greater or lesser degree. The truth is that it\u0026rsquo;s an extremely rare trait, at the same time that it is extremely necessary if we are ever to be part of God\u0026rsquo;s Virgin Army. We must be eager to know the truth about ourselves, even (and especially) if it shows us to be wrong. We must be prepared to change in response to that truth. To do this, we must be habitually open to correction. We must always have a healthy doubt about our own innocence. All of this can be painful. We can grow weary of constant correction. But we must not give up. For when we stop growing, we start dying. (See also Honest Doubt.)\nThere are people who have found in the teachings of Jesus an answer to every argument. They are able to use those teachings to show where every church on earth has fallen away from Christ. But these same people seek to grab the theory and then get as far away from us as they can. Why is that? It\u0026rsquo;s often because they do not want to be accountable to anyone else for their own shortcomings. They want to cover their own sinfulness. They want to put off being accountable for weaknesses that they are not willing to confront. They want to be able to impress everyone else with their own superior knowledge or discipline, but they do not want to be around others who may have more knowledge and experience than what they have, for fear that the truth will come out about their own guilt in some area.\n\u0026ldquo;Guile\u0026rdquo; leads all of these people to hide their \u0026ldquo;guilt\u0026rdquo; and run away from our light (and very often from the light of others as well). (See also Loose Cannons.)\nBecause they turn from the light, they turn from fellowship. But a guileless person walks in all the light that they can find, and they constantly seek more light. As a result they are drawn together by this common trait. The Bible says (1 John 1:7) \u0026ldquo;If we walk in the light as [God] is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, God\u0026rsquo;s Son, cleanses us from all sin.\u0026rdquo;\nIf we are walking in all the light we can find, we will be able to recognise other members of the Virgin Army, not by their organisational affiliations, not by the fact that they are unmarried, not by the fact that they do not work for money, and not by their claims to being born again, spirit-filled, etc. We will be able to recognise them by their total lack of guile.\nAnd such people can be found in the strangest of places.\nWhile it may be necessary at times to hide the truth from other people, between us and God there must be no cover-ups, no false illusions about our own righteousness if we want to be part of God\u0026rsquo;s Virgin Army. If we lose this humble brokenness before God, we lose everything. (See also Self-Righteousness.)\nA measure of this humble spirit will also rub off in our relationships with other sincere believers. It will be our lack of guile which will draw us to one another, and it will be our lack of guile that will challenge us all. There is a saying, \u0026ldquo;The sincere alone recognise sincerity.\u0026rdquo; Those who are daily seeking more of God\u0026rsquo;s light will be drawn to others who are doing the same.\nLet us each pray for more sincerity and for greater fellowship with others who are doing the same.\n"}]
