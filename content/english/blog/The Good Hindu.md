A religious man asked Jesus, "What can I do to have eternal life?"  
  
"Love God and your neighbour," Jesus answered.  
  
Because the man had little love, he asked, "Who is my neighbour?"  
  
Jesus then told a story:  
  
A man was beaten and robbed while travelling between Delhi and Calcutta. He was left by the road half dead.  
  
A Catholic priest saw him, but he was late for mass. So he looked away and passed by.  
  
A Protestant missionary also saw the man, but he was on his way to a Bible study, so he too looked the other way.  
  
Then a Hindu came and helped the man. He took him to a hospital and paid the bill, because the man had no money.  
  
"Now who was a good neighbour?" Jesus asked.  
  
"The Hindu," the religious man replied.  
  
"Then follow his example," Jesus commanded.
